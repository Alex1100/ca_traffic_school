# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome and thank you for choosing the California DMV licensed 5 Dollar Traffic School Stop Traffic Violator School. We know it's not fun to get a traffic ticket, but we want your traffic school experience to be painless, educational, and convenient. Our course uses plain English, gives you lots of examples, and doesn't bog you down with too many details. We want to change the way you are driving, and we feel the best way to do this is by changing your motivation to drive better. Rather than just tell you what you should be doing on the road, we try to give you the internal motivation to do the right thing. We also repeat the same concepts several times throughout the course, to help you pass the final exam in the end.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES
#### Reduce Traffic Collisions
Traffic collisions can be life-altering events that in many cases could have been avoided. In this course we will cover the different ways in which you can avoid traffic collisions and become a safer driver. What is a safer way to drive in bad weather? How can you share the road, making it safer for all road users? Understanding and applying the answers to these and other questions will make the road a safer place for everyone.

#### Reduce Traffic Law Violations
Have you forgotten when it is legal to make a u-turn? Do you remember what you need to do at a four-way stop? We will tackle all of these important points, helping you become a law-abiding driver. If you follow traffic laws you are less likely to receive a ticket. More importantly, you will also play an important part in keeping the roads safe, ensuring your own safety and the safety of those around you. The roads can't be safe if we don't all follow the law!

#### Responsibility
Driving is part of our daily routine, but this does not mean that it is not a serious task. As soon as you sit behind the wheel of a motor vehicle, you take on a huge responsibility. Throughout this course, we will show you what an important part you play in road safety. Once you sit behind that wheel, you are no longer only responsible for yourself, but for the community of drivers and road users around you. Don't take this role on lightly!

#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS
In order to pass the course, you have to read and study all the material. Remember, you have to be mentally present to study the material. Make sure you are awake and alert when you are studying! If you get tired, take a break. It's important to remain alert and focused while taking the course. To complete each section, you must take a short review quiz for that section. Each review quiz consists of 4 questions. In order to pass a review quiz, you must answer 3 questions (70%) correctly. Once you have completed all sections of the course, you will take a final exam. The final exam will consist of 25 questions. In order to pass the final exam and complete the course, you must answer 18 of these questions (70%) correctly. After you have passed the final exam, we ask that you complete the DMV course evaluation form.

#### WHAT TO EXPECT
The 5 Dollar Traffic School Stop course is separated into four (4) short sections. You can study the material at your own pace, and you can log off and log on as many times as you need. You can re-enter the course by going to the Returning Students area located on the right side of the home page.

#### Test Yourself Questions
Throughout the course you will see Test Yourself Questions at the bottom of many pages. These questions are there to help prepare you for the review quizzes and final exam. Don't skip over them! Take a few minutes and find the answers to these questions and write them down. They will help you pass the review quizzes and final exam.

#### The Review Quizzes
After each section you must complete a short 4-question review quiz. You must answer 70% (3 questions) correctly in order to pass. If you don't score 70%, you will be required to retake the quiz until you pass. Pay attention to the quizzes; they will help you pass the final exam.

#### The Final Exam
At the end of the course you will have a 25-question final exam. You must answer at least 70% (18 questions) correctly in order to pass the course and get your certificate of completion. If you don't get 70% right the first time, you will have one week to take the final exam a second time. If you still do not pass, you can take the course again at no cost!

# Chapter 2: Purpose of Traffic Laws

RECENT CHANGES IN THE LAW AND THE REASONING BEHIND THEM
Every year on January 1, a new set of traffic laws are put into effect. They often reflect technological changes or changes in driver habits. It's important to be aware of these annual changes and how they will affect your driving habits. Here are some of the current and upcoming law changes.


## EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016
- **Bicycle Reflector (VC 21201):**: When operating a bicycle in the dark on a highway or a sidewalk the bicycle must be equipped with a red reflector or a solid or flashing red light with a built-in reflector on the rear of the bicycle.
- **Slow Moving Vehicles (VC 21656)**: Vehicles moving at a speed less than the flow of traffic while on a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe, must turn off the roadway at the nearest place designated as a turnout or wherever sufficient area for a safe turnout exists if a line of 5 or more vehicles forms behind them.
- **Driver License for Exonerated Persons (VC 14903)**: The DMV must issue a no fee driver license to a person exonerated of a conviction and released from state prison within the previous six months.
- **Electric Bicycle Classes (VC 312.5, 12804.9, 21113, & 24016)**: There are now three classes of electric bicycles. All operators of a Class 3 (maximum speed of 28 miles per hour) electric bicycle must be 16 years old or older and are required to wear a bicycle helmet. There is no financial responsibility, driver's license, registration, or license plate requirement for electric bicycles.
- **Expanded Pedicab Definition (VC 467.5, 21215, 21215.5, & 23229)**: The definition of a pedicab (a small pedal-operated vehicle serving as a taxi) has expanded to include provisions that allow for consumption of alcoholic beverages by passengers until January 1, 2020. Additional operational and safety equipment is required for this new type of pedicab.

## EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2016
**California Residency Requirement (VC 12801.5)**: All original driver's license or identification card applicants must submit satisfactory proof of California residency. DMV is prohibited from issuing an original driver's license or identification card to a person who does not submit satisfactory proof of California residency. Note, this change in law does not take effect until July 1, 2016.

## EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017
Increased Accident Reportability Threshold (VC 1656.2, 1808, 1808.1, 12517.1, 13369, 13558, 16000, 16000.1, 16020.1, 16020.2, 16075, 16251, 16430, & 16434)
The minimum damage threshold for collision reportability has increased from $750 to $1,000. A driver of a motor vehicle involved in a collision with property damages greater than $1,000 must submit a Report of Traffic Accident Occurring in California (SR 1) to DMV. DMV is authorized to impose sanctions following an uninsured reportable collision. Note, this change in law does not take effect until January 1, 2017.

## Child Safety Seat Requirements (VC 27360)
In addition to the existing child passenger restraint system laws, any child who is under 2 years old must be secured in a rear-facing child passenger restraint system unless the child is 40 pounds or more, or 3'4" or taller. Note, this change in law does not take effect until January 1, 2017.

## RECENT CHANGES IN THE LAW AND THE REASONING BEHIND THEM (continued)

**Changes to Technology**: As technology changes the law must address these technological developments. As we incorporate more and more gadgets and gizmos into our driving habits, the laws have to change accordingly.

- **Dashboard**: The dashboard of a car has changed drastically over the past years. Whereas it once housed the speedometer, odometer and a few other necessities, it's now a complex system with navigation systems, built in phones and more. Cell phones, smart phones and navigation systems are everywhere, even inside cars!
- **Don't Try to Multitask**:All these tools can be helpful. If you're driving on an unfamiliar road, you can use your navigation system to guide you. If your car breaks down, you no longer have to search for a call box to call the towing company or the police. You have your cell phone and access to all the resources it offers. Unfortunately, many drivers think they can multitask while driving. Distracted driving is very dangerous and is one of the most common causes of collisions.
- **New Laws and Technology**: For this reason, state legislators are passing laws to address the problems caused by people using these gadgets while they drive. Laws regarding cell phone use and texting for example are intended to ensure that the driver is focused on the road. These laws are passed for your own safety and for the safety of other road users. Don't ignore them!
- **Changes to Driving Techniques**: Technological advancements are not restricted to dashboards, cell phones, and navigation systems. Technology has also advanced car performance and safety. Cars drive differently than they used to and their drivers have to adjust accordingly. Cars now come equipped with airbags, ABS (anti-lock braking system) brakes, front wheel and rear wheel driver, electronic traction control system and computerized engine components.

  Since cars have changed drastically over the past ten years, driving techniques have changed as well. Drivers have had to adapt to these new technologies. The techniques our parents learned to drive are very different from the ones we would learn today. Let's look at a couple of examples that will illustrate this point.
- **Braking Systems**: When cars were equipped with non-ABS brakes, drivers were instructed to pump the brakes in order to prevent the brakes from locking. Pumping non-ABS brakes made them more effective and reduced the braking distance (the distance required to bring the car to a stop). But with the standardization of ABS brakes in all newer cars, people are now taught to keep their foot on the brake pedal as hard as they can because the ABS does the pumping for them.
- **Seat Belt Pretensioners**: The modern car is also equipped with extensive safety measures that protect the driver and its passengers in the case of a collision. Seat belts have been found in cars for over fifty years. These seat belts however looked like the ones we have in airplanes today. It was assumed that drivers and passengers would adjust the belt so that it fit snuggly. Many people however were careless when it came to this. Even today, when you are on a plane, look around you. How many have actually tightly fastened their seat belts? Oftentimes they are loosely hanging around their waists or even hips! If the plane experiences turbulence or worse, the passenger with the loose seat belt will get tossed around inevitably. This is an even more dangerous prospect in a car, which unlike a plane, we use to travel on a daily basis. Car companies began to consider alternatives. In the 1980s they introduced seat belt pretensioners. Pretensioners automatically tighten the belt to prevent the individual from jerking forward in a collision or at a sudden stop. You no longer have to pull the adjustable strap to fit your body. This means that you are securely fastened, lowering your chances of moving around in a crash.

```
TEST YOURSELF:
1.  What is a seat belt pretensioner?
> Pretensioners automatically tighten the belt to prevent the individual from jerking forward in a collision or at a sudden stop.
2.  What are some types of vehicle technology advancements?
> Technological advancements are not restricted to dashboards, cell phones, and navigation systems. Technology has also advanced car performance and safety. Cars drive differently than they used to and their drivers have to adjust accordingly. Cars now come equipped with airbags, ABS (anti-lock braking system) brakes, front wheel and rear wheel driver, electronic traction control system and computerized engine components.

## REASONS FOR TRAFFIC LAWS
>John, Pablo and Maria carpool to work together every morning.  The traffic today is especially bad and Pablo is getting frustrated. He has an important presentation at work today and wanted to get to the office a few minutes early to prepare. At this rate, he might even be late for the presentation. “Go faster so you can make the pass the red light!” “Pass the car in front of you, he is going too slowly!” “Look, there’s the center lane, get in there so you can zip into the left turn only lane before everybody else!” says Pablo.
>
>But John doesn’t listen because he knows better. Maria says, “Pablo, I know you are in a hurry, but is it really worth it to break all those rules to save a few minutes? There are good reasons for traffic laws – By telling drivers what they can and can’t do, other drivers know what to expect. If John did what you were asking him to, other drivers who weren’t expecting us to pass the red light, or cut them off to the left turn lane, might not be able to stop in time to avoid hitting us. Even if we were in a smallest fender bender, don’t you think that would make you late for work?  What if it were a bigger crash?”
>
> “You’re right, Maria, I wasn’t thinking clearly. But at least we could have sped up and passed a few cars on our way to the green light ahead.”
>
>“So you wanted us to weave in and out of traffic?” says Maria. “All that would do is slow traffic down. Sure we might save a minute or two ourselves, but it’s exactly that kind of driving that creates problems on the road for everyone. I don’t see the point of doing that either.”

Some traffic laws seem to be a hassle and often an expensive hassle. You might ask yourself, why did someone think this was necessary? Why do we have so many traffic laws? If you are playing a board game or a sport, you always have a set of rules that you must follow. Without them, everyone would do as they pleased. How would you know how to play? How would you know who won or who lost? People could just play without taking turns. Eventually, you would have to stop the game because no one would know what they were doing or why they were doing it. The same applies for laws about driving. Traffic laws reduce chaos, keep traffic moving and give all road users a common understanding of how the road should be used.  Most importantly, though, their primary purpose is to keep everyone safe.

#### Common Understanding
In the case of driving however, rules and laws are even more essential. Driving is not just a game where your only options are winning or losing. Every time you step into a vehicle, hop on a bicycle or go for walk, you could risk your life. Laws allow drivers to know what to do and what to expect of other drivers. They allow drivers to anticipate the actions of other drivers and limit the number of surprises on the road.

#### Keeping Order and Movement in Traffic
Traffic laws also ensure that the road remains orderly. Imagine the chaos if everyone who used the road did anything they wanted? If we didn't have traffic laws, what would stop someone from driving in oncoming traffic or making a right turn from the left lane? Traffic would come to a stop and there would be chaos! It's because of laws that all the road users know when to stop and when to go, when and where to turn from and more. These laws help traffic move efficiently.

#### Safety
Without order we would be driving in chaos. And that can only mean one thing: danger. Traffic laws ensure the safety of everyone who uses the road. What if people drove through intersections at 60 mph? The lives of other drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists would be endangered. Rules help make the road a safer place.

Sometimes it feels like there are too many laws, restricting what we do in the car. Occasionally, they may be an inconvenience to follow these laws. You might think to yourself, "They passed another law? Another reason I can get a ticket?" Before you even consider breaking the law however, think about why that law was passed. It's not to inconvenience you or to annoy you; rather these laws are here to protect us all. Driving is a wonderful privilege but can be very hazardous. These laws minimize the risks and dangers of the road. Protect yourself and other road users. Follow the rules of the road!

```
TEST YOURSELF:
1.  The reason we have traffic laws is so we always have a set of rules that you must follow.
2.  Why do traffic laws exist? - Without them, everyone would do as they pleased.
```

## Chapter 3: The Price You Pay for Careless Driving

### DAMAGE TO CARS AND PROPERTY

#### Minor Damage to Your Car
A minor collision, even a small dent or scrape, can be a hassle and force you to put your life on hold. If you decide to get your car repaired, you have to take pictures of the damage, make time-consuming phone calls to insurance companies and research repair shops.  Then when the time comes to leave your car at the repair shop for several days, you have to figure out how you will get around. Will you rent a car or rely on friends and family? If you have children, you will have to remove that tricky car seat and install it in another car and then put it back into yours. In other words, this will just add to your long list of errands that are already taking away from your free time.

#### Major Damage to Your Car
Major car damage has far worse consequences with an out-of-pocket cost that can make it difficult or impossible to get your car repaired. If the repair is hugely expensive you will have a limited number of options: getting into debt to pay for the repairs or if it's possible, to hold off on the repairs until you can pay for them. If the damage is more than cosmetic, however, that won't be an option. If you've damaged someone else's property, you'll have to pay for that too. Can you afford to pay for all of this? Isn't it better to drive in a way that avoids these problems?


# PEOPLE CAN BE INJURED OR KILLED

#### Minor Injuries
Even a small injury can take weeks to heal and could be potentially painful. Minor injuries will still mean scheduling numerous and costly doctor's visits and taking medications that might interfere with your daily life.

#### Major Injuries
Minor injuries are often a nuisance; but major injuries can be devastating, either for a short time or forever. A broken bone, such as a broken leg, could leave you home bound for up to six weeks. These are six weeks that you will have to take off work, possibly without pay. Also, you will be unable to function as you normally would, having to inconvenience yourself and those around you. Those six weeks will be filled with hospital and doctor's visits, x-rays, and casts that will be re-fitted accordingly.

A broken bone will eventually heal, but more severe injuries are also possible. Back injuries are some of the most common types of injuries that happen after car collisions. Back problems can stay with you for the rest of your life, forcing you to change your lifestyle. If you are an active person and enjoy running, hiking, or skiing, a back injury can jeopardize your ability to do what you love. A spinal cord injury can leave you paralyzed forever.

#### Death
Collisions can lead to the death of a loved one, a stranger or yourself. The knowledge that you were responsible for killing another human being, can leave you emotionally scarred for life. Nightmares, anxiety and depression can take over your ability to function. Being killed and leaving behind your grieving family and friends to deal with the loss isn't much better. Therefore, it is in your interest and in the interest of those around you to be a careful driver.

## HOW YOUR AUTO INSURANCE IS AFFECTED

#### How Insurance Works
In the state of California, it is mandatory to have auto insurance. There are, however, different kinds of coverage that vary in the types of damage and personal injury they cover and how much they cost. The most basic (and required by law) is called **minimum liability coverage. This type of insurance pays for the damages done to another person's vehicle or body and only for the amount of the coverage. In other words, if you are at fault for a crash and only have a $15,000 liability policy, your insurance will only pay for $15,000 of the damages done to the other person and their car.  Anything more than the $15,000 is your responsibility.  Your own medical expenses and car repairs are your own responsibility too.**

In many cases, even a small at-fault crash will cost you a lot of money.  Most insurance policies have a deductible that you have to pay before the insurance kicks in.  Let's say you're in a crash and it's going to cost $7,500 to get the other driver's car fixed and your deductible is $1,000. This means you have to pay $1,000 out of your own pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the $6,500 to get the car completely fixed. And this doesn't even count your own expenses. Even with car insurance, there's good financial incentive to avoid any type of collision.

#### Collisions Are Expensive
What happens to your insurance rate if you do get into a collision?  If you are at-fault for a minor collision (which will stay on your record for three years), the insurance company, trying to recover the costs from the collision pay out, will charge you a higher premium until it is off your record. Even worse, if you decided to get the cheapest option (the insurance with minimum coverage) and are in a major crash, there will be some serious out-of-pocket expenses.  For example, **_according to the California Highway Patrol (CHP) the estimated cost for a victim who was severely injured in an auto collision is $247,000._** The minimum insurance coverage of $15,000 doesn't even cover 10% of that. Even minor injuries cost $26,000. How will you pay for the rest?

Minimum insurance won't cover your own medical expenses or car repairs either - only the other driver's and only for the specific dollar amounts. This means you are responsible for and will have to pay for any damages that are more than the minimum amount. Aren't there better ways to spend your money?

```

Anything more than the $15,000 is your responsibility.  Your own medical expenses and car repairs are your own responsibility too.
2. What is the average cost for a severe injury in a collision? **$247,000**

```

## FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND DMV PROBLEMS

#### Financial Impact
As we've just seen, even if you have the minimum insurance required by the DMV, a collision can cost you a small fortune. If you only have minimum coverage, you'll have to pay for the damage to your own car, and for the medical attention that you and your passengers require. And don't forget your deductible. The typical $1000 deductible is the amount you have to pay out of your own pocket before your insurance even goes into effect to pay the rest.  Finally, expect to pay higher insurance premiums for at least 3 years.

#### Legal Action
In addition to your own costs, if the collision was your fault, you will probably have to pay the other driver's costs too. Even if you have insurance, the other driver can sue you for negligence and win. If you rear-end someone, for example, you will be considered responsible for the collision and might get sued by the driver or his insurance company. If someone dies in the collision, the victim's family could go after you for wrongful death. If they do seek out legal action, then you will have to get a lawyer to defend yourself. If the property damage is more than the insurance coverage (after all, there's only so much your insurance will pay for), you could lose your house, car, and other assets.

#### DMV Action
Finally, you have to think about how this will affect your driving record and even your privilege to drive. The California DMV operates on a demerit point system to track careless and dangerous drivers. Every at-fault collision and traffic violation will add points to your record. For example, a minor at-fault collision will cost you one point and stays on your driving record for three years. More serious violations such as reckless driving and speeding over 100 mph have a penalty of two points and stay on your record for seven years. A DUI will stay on your record for a full 10 years! Get four or more points in 12 months (six points in 24 months or eight points in 36 months) and your license can be suspended or revoked. If you are eligible to get your license reinstated, you'll have to wait at least 30 days. You will then have to pay hundreds of dollars in fees and fines.

```
TEST YOURSELF
1. Why should you be afraid of legal problems after a collision that was your fault even if you have insurance?
If you rear-end someone, for example, you will be considered responsible for the collision and might get sued by the driver or his insurance company. If someone dies in the collision, the victim's family could go after you for wrongful death. If they do seek out legal action, then you will have to get a lawyer to defend yourself. If the property damage is more than the insurance coverage (after all, there's only so much your insurance will pay for), you could lose your house, car, and other assets. Finally, you have to think about how this will affect your driving record and even your privilege to drive

## QUALITY OF LIFE
Careless driving also impacts your quality of life. Much of your free time is devoted to dealing with the aftermath of a collision. The out-of-pocket costs for repairs, lawyers' fees, and higher insurance premiums mean less money to spend on yourself and your favorite activities. If you are injured because of a collision, acute or chronic pain could alter your mood and prevent you from having an active lifestyle. Finally, if you have a major collision and seriously injure or kill someone else, you could carry around guilt and pain for the rest of your life. Is it worth it?

### WHAT CAUSES COLLISIONS?
There are a number of factors that can increase your chances of being in a collision. In this section, we will look at why drivers have car crashes and what we can do to avoid them. The US Department of Transportation has listed the following as some of the most likely contributors to collisions.

#### Alcohol and Drugs
Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is one of the most common factors that lead to collisions, and one that can be easily avoided. When you are driving, you need to use your eyes, hands, and feet to control the vehicle, but it is the brain that controls all these parts of the body. When you use drugs or alcohol, your brain has a hard time telling your body what to do. You can't make quick and safe decisions, which puts you and those around you at risk.

#### Distracted Driving
Inattention is another factor that can lead to minor and serious collisions. Remember, in order to drive safely, you need to use a number of senses and skills, including sight, judgment, and proper reaction time. If you are distracted while you are driving by fiddling with the gadgets and gizmos on the dashboard, eating, applying makeup, or doing any number of things that drivers are known to do, you are not giving your full attention to the most important task ahead of you - driving.

#### Sleepy Driver
A sleepy driver is as dangerous as a drunk driver. Just like someone who is driving while using drugs or alcohol, a sleepy driver has a slow reaction time, difficulty processing what he sees and hears and making safe decisions. Some of the most common signs of a sleepy driver include constant yawning, trouble keeping your head up and your eyes focused, and as a result, swerving into other lanes. The only solution for drowsiness is to pull over into a well-lit, safe place and take a nap.

If you are feeling any of these symptoms, coffee or another caffeinated drink may improve your alertness temporarily. This is a short term improvement, however, not solution. It doesn't replace a good night's sleep.

#### Speeding
Even if you are a sober, alert, and focused driver, if you are speeding your chances of getting into a collision dramatically increase. In fact, speeding is one of the top causes of collisions. **In 2010, the California Highway Patrol reported that speeding was the primary factor in 29% of fatal and injury collisions.** The higher the speed the less likely the driver can respond in time to any obstacles or other drivers. If you do get into a collision and you or the other party is speeding, you also increase your chances of getting seriously injured and damaging your car. The faster you are driving, the greater the force and intensity with which you will hit the other car, the pole, the tree, or whatever it is that you collide with.

#### Move Over/Slow Down (VC 21809, 25253)
The new law makes two previous laws indefinite. VC Section 21809 requires that if you are driving on a freeway and approach in a lane immediately adjacent to a stopped emergency vehicle with flashing emergency lights or a tow truck with flashing warning lights, or a marked Department of Transportation vehicle with flashing warning lights you must change your lane to give them space or slow down. VC 25253 requires tow trucks that are used to tow disabled vehicles to be equipped with flashing amber warning lights. If a tow truck is providing service to a vehicle, then its amber lights can be flashing. The law however prohibits tow trucks from flashing these lights on a freeway unless there is an unusual traffic hazard or an extremely hazardous situation.

## THE DMV POINT SYSTEM

The California DMV, Highway Patrol and traffic court system take driving safety very seriously. Driving is a privilege, not a right. The DMV point system, called NOTS, was designed to keep track of drivers' offenses so they can suspend or revoke a license if needed.  If you can't follow the rules of driving safely, you will lose your privilege to drive.

#### Negligent Operator Treatment System
The Negligent Operator Treatment System (NOTS) is a program the DMV uses to keep track of bad drivers. The system adds points to the driver's record for convictions involving a moving vehicle violation (traffic tickets) and at-fault collisions. These points stay on your record for 36 months. There are serious consequences for drivers who have too many points.

Conviction for most traffic citations will add one point to your record. The exceptions, which count for two points, are:

* Reckless driving
* Leaving the scene of a collision
* Driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs
* Driving the wrong way on a freeway
* Speeding in excess of 100 mph
* Participating in a motor vehicle speed contest on a highway
* Vehicular manslaughter or causing injury or death while evading police
* Using a motor vehicle while committing a crime
* Transporting explosives illegally

If the driver causes a crash while committing a traffic violation, one extra point is added to his record in addition to the violation points. That means a driver who was in a collision because he was driving recklessly will get a total of three (3) points on his record. A driver is a negligent operator if he/she accumulates:

* Four (4) points in one year.
* Six (6) points in two years.
* Eight (8) points over three years.

The driver can be put on probation for one year (including a six month suspension) or lose their license. At the end of the suspension or revocation period, drivers need to re-apply for a license to drive.

#### DUI CHANGES LIVES FOREVER
One night of drinking and driving can change your life and the lives of others forever.

A DUI is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine and/or jail time. If anyone is injured from a collision while a driver is under the influence, the charge becomes a felony. A felony is punishable by a heavy fine, an automatic jail term, an extended probationary period, and a permanent criminal record as a convicted felon.

#### Your Emotional Health
Getting a DUI can be a traumatic event. If you end up in jail for your DUI, it can be embarrassing to explain this to friends and family. The emotional impact will be much more devastating if your drunk-driving has injured or killed someone else.

#### DUI Is Expensive
DUIs are also very expensive offenses. The trial and attorney fees could range between $5,000 to $8,000 and more. Fines and penalties on average cost about $4,000. And of course, your insurance rates will skyrocket. Over the course of ten years you could be paying an extra $20,000 to $30,000 for car insurance. Over a ten-year period, **all of these expenses could add up to over $40,000!**

Keep in mind that this is only for the DUI itself. This doesn't include any of the costs associated with causing a crash while under the influence, such as hospital expenses. The victim or his family could also file a lawsuit against you and if they win, you can lose everything you have.

#### DUI Will Take Away Your Freedom
Apart from the financial burden, a DUI also has other repercussions. You will face a mandatory jail time of 96 hours to six months and your license can be suspended for up to six months. If the vehicle is registered in the driver's name, it may be impounded for up to 30 days. You may also be required to have an ignition interlock device for up to three years which will prevent the operation of the vehicle when alcohol is detected on the driver's breath.

#### The Victims and their Families
Sometimes the drunk driver escapes a crash unharmed, but leaves behind a victim who is severely injured or killed. The victim's family must live with this for the rest of their lives.

#### Society
Drunk drivers are not only a burden on themselves and their victims, but also on society as a whole. It costs local and state authorities millions of dollars a year to pay for the paramedics, police, and fire department that are responding to those drunk driving crashes. That's why we have tax increases and service cutbacks every year.

#### Chemical Testing for DUI (VC 23612)
Prior to January 1, 2013, persons lawfully arrested for a DUI had the option of a blood, breath, or urine chemical test. Under current legislation, however, the individual only has the option of a breath or blood test unless there is special situation. A urine test may be used if:

* Both blood and breath tests are unavailable.
* The individual is a hemophiliac.
* The individual is taking anticoagulant medication.

#### Driving Under the Influence (VC 13352, 13352.5, 23109, 23550, 23550.5, 23552, 23566, 23568)
If you have been convicted of a DUI, you are not allowed to drive with a blood alcohol level (BAC) of .01 percent or greater while on probation for the DUI. If you are pulled over and asked to submit a to a Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS) test (a breathalyzer test) you have to accept. If you refuse or if you agree and have a BAC of .01 or greater, a citation will be issued, your license will be taken, driving privileges will be suspended and your car will be impounded.

If you have been convicted of two misdemeanor DUIs, your license will be suspended for 90 days. After this point, you can obtain a restricted driver’s license. Regardless of whether it’s a second or third conviction, you must enroll in a DUI program and must install and maintain an IID in your vehicle.

If you are convicted of alcohol-related reckless driving and you have had a prior conviction for alcohol-related reckless driving or DUI within the past ten years, the court will order you to participate in a licensed DUI program for at least nine months. If you do not enroll in, participate in, or complete a licensed DUI program, the court has to revoke your probation.

If you are arrested with a BAC of .15 percent or greater, the court can consider installing an IID for a first-time offender convicted of an alcohol-related DUI.

#### Driving Under the Influence (DUI) Repeat Offenders (VC 23597)
Under this law, if you have been convicted of three or more DUIs, the court could revoke your license for ten years. However, you will have the opportunity to apply for a reinstatement of your license after five years, if you have installed an Ignition Interlock Device in your car.

#### Ignition Interlock Devices (IID) Pilot Program
A pilot program will be in effect from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015, in the counties of Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare. If you have been convicted of a DUI and want to have your license reissued, you have to install an IID in any vehicle you operate. The new law also establishes the requirements for installation. The length of time the IID will be installed will depend on the number of DUIs you have and whether they were misdemeanors or felonies.

## Chapter 4: Rights and Responsibilities of a Pedestrian

We all know that we have to be careful when we drive. Even if you're walking however you have to be cautious. The only way to make sure that both the driver and the pedestrian are safe is to know the rights and responsibilities of pedestrians.

What should and shouldn't a pedestrian do? Let's see what Maria, a typical suburban California mom, does when she is a pedestrian.  Maria has decided to take a day off from driving. Instead of driving to the grocery store like she usually does, she's going to walk there. What are some of the things that Maria has to remember?

#### CROSS AT INTERSECTIONS AND CROSSWALKS
First of all, Maria knows that when she crosses the street she has to cross at intersections and inside crosswalks. Maria knows that the grocery store is in the middle of the block and there is no crosswalk there. It would be easier to run across the street, directly across the grocery store. But she also knows that it would be illegal and dangerous. So instead, she walks to the end of the block, where there is a crosswalk.

Once she reaches the crosswalk, she makes sure to look at the signal light. Even though the light is green, she sees the red hand which tells her not to cross. After the light has turned green she can safely cross, but only after looking left, right, and left before crossing. She also makes eye contact with the drivers, so that she knows that they have seen her.

#### FACE TRAFFIC
Maria lives in a neighborhood where there are sidewalks, so it's very clear as to where she should be walking. What do you do if there is no sidewalk? By law, if you are walking in an area outside of a business or residential district and there are no sidewalks, you are required to walk facing traffic on the left hand side of the road. The only exception to this law is if you have no safe place to cross the street to get to the left side then you may walk on the right side of the road with traffic. For safety reasons anytime there are no sidewalks it is best to walk in the direction facing traffic even if you are within a business or residential district. It's only by facing the cars that you can ensure that drivers see you. This is also the best way to see a problem, such as a possible collision, before it happens. Also, stay as far to the side of the road as possible so that you are away from traffic. By following these two rules, you will have more time to avoid a dangerous and possibly deadly situation.

#### BLIND PEDESTRIANS
The final point drivers and pedestrians should remember is that blind or partially blind pedestrians always have the right-of-way. These people can be identified by their white canes or seeing eye dogs.  They are the most vulnerable of all road users so it is up to the drivers to ensure that they are not endangered. Drivers are always responsible for these pedestrians.

Blind pedestrians navigate the streets differently and use different ways of communicating. For example they rely on the sound of your vehicle to understand if a car is near, or if they should begin to cross. So drivers should be sure to stop within 5 feet of the crosswalk to give the pedestrian ample opportunity to hear the car. Drivers of electric or hybrid cars should be extra cautious around blind pedestrians, because with a car so quiet it may be impossible for the pedestrian to hear you approaching. Also, when a blind person pulls in his or her cane and steps away from the intersection, this gesture usually means that they will not be crossing at this time and for the driver to go.

It is up to the driver to ensure that these pedestrians are safe. If there is any collision or injury to an impaired pedestrian it is always the driver's fault.

Remember, we are all using the road together, so we should make sure it's safe for everyone. Pedestrians should know that they should cross at crosswalks and follow light signals. Drivers should always be aware of pedestrians, scan the road, and make sure to let pedestrians cross.

## Chapter 5: Your Responsibilities as a Driver

Every time you get behind the wheel of a car, you are taking on a huge responsibility. You should always remember that a car is a dangerous weapon. It is one ton of glass, metal, and plastic that can be flying down a road. If anything gets in its way, it could destroy life and property. Knowing that you have this powerful and potentially destructive weapon in your hands, you should control it with care and respect. Driving is a privilege as well as a responsibility. Every time you place your key in that ignition and start the car, you are responsible for the safety of everyone using the road.

**KNOWING WHEN NOT TO DRIVE**

This is a huge responsibility! And it’s left up to you to know when you can and can’t drive. Driving involves a variety of skills and senses. Before you get behind the wheel, you should be sure that you are awake, alert, and undistracted. Many factors can alter your mental state and your ability to focus and react quickly. The obvious factors, alcohol and drugs, are not the only things you should be concerned about. You might be surprised, but even commonplace factors like exhaustion and stress can affect your ability to drive. Before you turn on the car and press the gas, ask yourself, “Do I feel awake and alert? Would I be worried if I was sharing the road with a loved one?”

#### Personal Reasons
#### Tired or Drowsy
Much like being drunk or being an overwhelmed computer, when you are drowsy, you have a slower reaction time and it takes you longer to process information. Not only are you slower to respond to changes in your environment, but you are also likely to have blurry vision. In fact, research has proven that sleepiness also impairs driving by increasing the driver's carelessness.

If you are driving tired it can feel like you're back in high school sitting in one of your most boring classes. You want to stay awake and you want to pay attention, but sometimes it feels impossible! Inevitably, your head starts bobbing back and forth, your eyes have a hard time staying open, and the next thing you know, your eyes are shut and your teacher is yelling at you to wake up. It might be funny to think back on those moments. But there is nothing funny about feeling drowsy while sitting behind the wheel.

Everyone, at one point or another, feels tired and drowsy. Certain groups of people, however, have lifestyles or jobs that are more likely to make them drowsy while they drive. These people are more likely to fall asleep while driving and these are the people that need to be the most cautious. This group includes:

Young people: 18-26 year olds, especially young men, are more likely to be sleep deprived because of a combination of factors that include late night socializing, school, jobs, and extracurricular activities.  
Shift workers: Shift workers refers to those groups of people who work night shifts or late night shifts, work irregular hours, or simply work long hours.  
Truck drivers: Truck drivers drive long distances, usually with a minimum daily mile requirement. This forces drivers to drive at night, when there is less traffic, and to continue driving with little or no breaks. If you've driven long distances, you know how difficult it can be. Even if you don't feel drowsy at first, a couple of hours of driving can make you feel exhausted and sleepy.  
(Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)

What can you do?

Sleep and take naps: The best you can do to avoid driving drowsy is to get adequate sleep every night. While everyone requires a different amount of sleep, 7-8 hours a night is average. Even a few hours of lost sleep can affect your driving! If you don't manage to get a full night's rest, try taking a break for a short nap.   
Watch out for the warning signs: If you're driving and find yourself constantly yawning, you feel your eyes closing or your vision blurring, these are all your body's way of telling you that you're tired. If you are feeling any of these symptoms of drowsiness, you shouldn't continue driving!  
Caffeine: If you are feeling any of these symptoms one thing you can do is pull over and drink some coffee or another caffeinated drink. Even in small doses, caffeine can improve alertness. Two cups of coffee will last a few hours, but it doesn't replace a good night's sleep.  
Regular stops: If you're driving long distances, you should stop every hundred miles or once every two hours. If possible, pull over at a rest stop step outside and take a short walk. This will help you stretch out your legs and regain the ability to focus. If there is someone in the car with you, why not share the responsibility of driving?  
Alcohol and medications: Both alcohol and medications can make you feel extremely drowsy. Avoid alcohol if you'll be driving and make sure your medications won't cause drowsiness.

### KNOWING WHEN NOT TO DRIVE (continued)
Feeling Overly Emotional
On an average Wednesday, you've come home from an exhausting day at work. You barely survived the day; you almost got into an argument with your boss. But it's all over; you are finally home and can relax. You walk in and after a brief hello from your spouse, you are given a list of chores that he or she would like you to do before the day is over. Today? Does this have to get done today? Yes, apparently it does. The stresses and anxieties of the day now seem to be out of control and both of you start arguing with one another. Before the yelling escalates, you grab your keys and head for the car. You think that a nice, long drive will clear your head and calm you down.

This might have been the worst thing you could do to "relax." Most of us don't even think about how our emotions can affect our driving. If you're upset or mad, you are likely to transfer these emotions onto the road. Even if you're not usually prone to road rage, you're more likely to experience it if you start driving when you're already angry or upset. Because different parts of your mind and body impact one another. Your emotions impact your alertness and your ability to perform tasks. For example, intense emotions physically affect your body and your brain. Stress and anger put your body into "fight or flight mode" -- your heart pumps faster, muscles tighten, adrenaline increases, and breathing quickens. This interferes with your brain's ability to think and focus on driving. Besides, you are probably going to spend that "relaxing" drive rehashing the fight and getting more and more frustrated, distracting yourself and increasing your chances of a collision.

This, of course, is when your road rage emerges. You look at fellow drivers differently. You start believing that everyone is on the road to inconvenience and aggravate you, and to cut in front of you. So you decide to act accordingly. You were angry before you got behind the wheel, but now you're furious. You're probably going to drive recklessly and make some poor, last-minute decisions.

Avoid these situations! Don't drive when you're upset or angry. If you need to clear your head and calm down, go for a walk instead and leave the car keys at home.

Can't Focus on Driving

When you decide to sit behind a wheel and drive, you are taking on a serious responsibility. It is a skill that requires your full attention. You shouldn't be trying to eat your breakfast, drink your coffee, or hold conference calls while you're in the car. You might think that you are focused on driving, but if you are multi-tasking that means your brainpower is divided between the different tasks and driving is not getting your full attention.

The road is full of obstacles and surprises. Even if you're just daydreaming or chatting with your passengers, you are distracted. If there is any change in the road, it's going to take you longer to react, increasing your chances of a collision. Instead of taking a chance, just focus on the road!

### KNOWING WHEN NOT TO DRIVE (continued)


**Poor Vision**

As a driver, it is essential that you see well. After all, your sight gives you most of the information you need to make the right decisions on the road. Your eyes take in the information that your brain processes. It makes quick calculations and lets your body know what to do.

For this reason the DMV requires licensed drivers to have at least a minimum visual acuity (the ability to see items clearly and sharply including small details). Here are the minimum requirements to get your license:

- 20/40 with both eyes tested together and
- 20/40 in one eye and
- 20/70, at least, in the other eye

Of course, the DMV only requires an occasional eye exam so that you can get your license. Once the eye exam is over, it's up to you to monitor your vision. As we age, our vision deteriorates, but without regular eye exams, only you can decide if your vision is getting worse. If there is any change in your vision, you should take this seriously and make an appointment with an optometrist. Deteriorating vision in drivers is dangerous to the driver and to those he or she shares the road with. Loss of central vision, double vision, and changes to your depth perception (the ability to figure out how far away an object is), night vision or peripheral vision (the ability to see out of the corner of your eye) are serious problems that make driving more difficult and dangerous. Keep everyone safe and keep track of changes in your vision.

#### Medications and Alcohol

If you plan to drive, don't even have one drink! Alcohol will contribute to or even create a sense of drowsiness. Just like alcohol, many drugs can induce drowsiness. Even if it's not a prescription, it can still make you drowsy! Both prescription and over-the-counter medications can make you sleepy, especially tranquilizers, antihistamines (most often found in allergy medications), and cold medications. Before you get behind the wheel, read the package or ask your doctor about the effects of your medication. The combination of medications and alcohol can make you even drowsier and will have more dangerous health effects. Never mix the two especially if you plan on driving!

### KNOWING WHEN NOT TO DRIVE (continued)
External Reasons
Even if you make sure you're alert, not too emotional, and focused, there are external factors that can affect your driving too. While you can't control some of these external factors, such as the weather or how others drive, you can take the necessary steps to make sure you are a prepared driver.

#### Weather or Road Conditions Are Beyond Your Driving Ability
The weather and the condition of the road are two of the most obvious external factors that drivers can't control. Road and weather conditions can vary greatly and sometimes change suddenly. You could be driving on a beautiful, clear day and suddenly, the clouds could descend upon you and you find yourself in the middle of a heavy storm. At this point, you have to decide whether or not it's safe for you to drive.

The skills you need to drive in a storm are very different from the skills you need to drive on a quiet, country road. Just because you have a license and a car doesn't mean that you are capable of driving in every condition. It's up to you to be a self-regulating driver. This means you decide whether or not you can drive in certain conditions. If there is a sudden storm and you feel uncomfortable driving, then exit the highway or pull over to the side. Don't take chances. You don't have anything to prove, just wait for the storm to pass. Make good decisions about driving and always consider the current driving conditions.



#### Your Vehicle's Condition
We've considered many factors within the car, such as yourself and other passengers that can impact your ability to drive well. Don't forget, however, that you also have to take care of your vehicle! It's fine if you're a cautious driver, but if your car is in dire need of repairs or a wash, you're being a negligent driver. How can you expect your car to get you around town if you don't take care of it? Keep your car in proper driving condition. Make sure your windows and mirrors are clean and properly adjusted, all of your lights are functioning, your tires have enough tread, you have enough gas, and you regularly check the car's fluids. Just like you can't go for a jog with a sprained ankle or without proper nutrition beforehand, you shouldn't drive a car that has mechanical problems or that's low on gas.

### License, Registration or Insurance Problems
It's not just your vehicle that you have to be concerned about maintaining. You need to make sure your paperwork is in order and up to date. Apart from the legal and financial consequences of driving without the proper paperwork, you could also lose the privilege to drive.
- **Driving Without a Valid California License:** If you choose to drive but you never had a license or didn't get a California license after moving to the state, you can be charged with a misdemeanor or an infraction. If you get charged with a misdemeanor you could face up to one year of jail time and a hefty fine; an infraction version of this offense if punishable by fine only.
- **Driving With a Suspended or Revoked License**: Driving with a suspended or revoked license is a much more serious offense and is a misdemeanor. Upon the first conviction, you could be imprisoned in the county jail for up to six months or have to pay a fine that could be anywhere between $300 and $1000. You could even be punished by both jail time and a fine. It could also lead to the impoundment of your vehicle and points on your record.
- **Outdated Registration**: If your registration has expired and you've parked your car on the street, your car could be towed. In addition to the impound fees you'll have to pay to retrieve your car, you will also have to pay penalties and fines for updating your expired registration.
- **No Insurance**: If you are caught driving without any insurance, you could be fined up to $200 on your first conviction. In addition, you could have your car impounded and your license suspended. If you get into a collision and don't have any insurance you might have to pay out of pocket for any injuries or damages. If you're caught driving without car insurance it could cost you twice as much (or more) as what you would have spent for one year of auto insurance. If you're trying to save money, cut your budget from somewhere else. This could be a very expensive gamble!
```

## COMMUNICATING WITH OTHER ROAD USERS
---
As children, we are always taught to share. If you have a brother, sister, cousin, or friend you are told that you have to share your toys. Your parents don't insist that you give your toys away, but they do remind you that there are other children around and you shouldn't be selfish. Maybe you play with one toy for fifteen minutes and then switch toys with your friends. Even at this young age you learn to communicate and share so everyone is happy. Well, these rules still hold true when you're an adult, especially on the road. We share the road with other drivers and pedestrians. With this sharing comes communication. We all have to communicate with one another, whether it's with appropriate hand signals, using your turn signals or making eye contact. Any time you are going to change your course you should make sure the vehicles and when applicable, the pedestrians around you know what you're up to.
- **Turn signals:** Turn signals are the most common and easiest way to communicate your intentions to others. Letting people know that you are going to turn or change lanes allows time to make a decision about what they should do.
- **Eye contact:** Eye contact is especially useful when communicating with pedestrians. Eye contact can be reassuring for pedestrians when they are trying to cross the street. It's the best way to let them know that you see them.
- **Flashing headlights:** This is an effective way to get someone's attention especially at night. Just be cautious about using this method directly in people's eyes. The bright light of the high beams can be blinding.
- **Horn**: The horn is the most used and abused communication tool. You should only use your horn to warn others of a problem on the road or to let another driver or pedestrian know you're there. This doesn't mean you charge ahead, assuming everyone else on the road knows you're coming. If a car is backing out of a driveway, don't just honk your horn and continue driving! The other driver still might not notice you. Slow down and make sure the driver sees you before continuing. It's also important to remember that your horn is not a self-expression tool. You should not use your horn to convey anger or frustration at another driver! Unnecessary horns just frustrate everyone around!

```
TEST YOURSELF:
1.	What can you do to communicate with other road users?
Turn Signals, Eye Contact, Flash Headlights, Horn, Hand Signals
```
---
## BEING COURTEOUS
---
Part of sharing something, whether it's a toy or the road, is being courteous. Being courteous means being polite and considerate. Remember, you are sharing the road, so not only should you think about yourself but about everyone else on the road. After all, if you're a courteous driver, it means you're a safe driver. If another driver is trying to change lanes, give them the chance to do so. Don't speed up and try to stop them from switching lanes! It can be frustrating if someone suddenly decides they have to change their lane to exit the freeway. What's the point of being rude and not giving them the chance to pass? What if that was you? What if you had to exit the freeway and if you missed this exit, the next one wasn't for another three miles? Wouldn't you hope the other drivers would be courteous and let you pass? You should always be courteous and treat others the way you want to be treated. This means on the road too! If everyone on the road were a little more polite and considerate, the road would be a safer place for everyone using it.

### FOLLOWING THE RULES OF THE ROAD

Imagine driving on a road where there were no rules. You could drive in any direction, you didn't know when to stop or when to go, when you could turn or where you could turn from. Imagine that you were surrounded by other drivers who had no idea if there were any rules or what they were. It's a scary thought, because this would be chaos. What's even more frightening is that all these drivers have dangerous weapons - their cars.

The only way to avoid chaos is to know the rules and to follow them. Sometimes it might seem like there are too many rules to keep up with, but rules tell you how to behave as well as what you can expect of other drivers. These rules make the road a safer place, so learn them and follow them!


### DEALING WITH ROAD HAZARDS

The road, often times, resembles an obstacle course. You have to be aware of other road users as well as the challenges that the road itself presents. How many times have you driven on a street and encountered a huge pothole or a stretch of road that needs to be re-paved? How many times have you driven down the freeway at 60mph and have had a cardboard box or a plastic bag making its way towards you? These hazards can be as dangerous, if not more so, than other drivers, pedestrians, or road users. Apart from these inanimate objects, you can also encounter other vehicles that suddenly stop. What's the best way to deal with these hazards?

Always follow the rules of the road: The rules of the road have been implemented to keep you and others safe. If you keep within the speed limit, for example, you are less likely to get into a collision. If you maintain a safe following distance of at least three seconds (covered further in Ch. 7), instead of tailgating the car in front you, you can spot a hazard more easily. You'll also have more time to come to a stop.

Scan the road: You should also practice proper scanning techniques. Look forward at least 10-15 seconds ahead, use your peripheral vision to see to your side and your mirrors to see behind you. You obviously should keep your eyes on the road, but make sure you also know what’s happening everywhere else. Is the car two cars ahead slowing down? Is the pedestrian at the intersection up ahead about to cross? Is a car coming up behind you really fast? If you’re properly scanning ahead, to the sides and behind you, you’ll see the hazard earlier on; this will give you more time to think and react.  

React to the hazard: Once you've scanned the road and realized you can't avoid the hazard, think quickly. Accept that there's a hazard and make a quick decision. Use your best judgment. Think about who or what is around you. Is it better to slow down, stop or swerve? The more experienced you are as a driver, the more you'll have honed these skills. But never take your experience for granted. Anything can surprise you.

### POOR DRIVING CONDITIONS

Poor weather and road conditions make driving more complicated. Bad weather makes it harder to see and be seen. It makes the roads slippery. This especially becomes a problem if you don't have experience driving in extreme weather. The best thing to do is to avoid driving in bad weather. Listen to or watch the weather report. If it appears that the conditions are going to be especially dangerous, wait for the weather to improve. This isn't always possible, however, so make sure you're prepared!

### Be Prepared
The best way to be prepared is to know what to expect before you get into the car. Listen to a current weather report. Are you anticipating heavy rains? Do your windshield wipers work? If the roads are going to be slippery, do your tires have enough traction? If it's going to snow or you're expecting ice on the road, do you have tire chains? It's important to check that you have all your safety equipment and that it's all functioning properly.

### On the Road
Once you've checked all your safety equipment and you get on the road, you should take as many precautions as you can.

See and be seen: Just like the hippest celebrity hangouts ask that you see and be seen, so does the road in extreme weather. Use your low beam headlights and fog lights, if you have them, for the most visibility with least glare.  High beam headlights will only reflect back and make it even harder to see. Turn on your wipers and defroster to keep the windshield as clear as possible. If needed you may have to stop to clean mud or snow off the headlights and windows.

Slow down: Posted speed limits apply to perfect driving conditions. If you're driving in bad weather, you should drive slowly. Don't assume that either you or your vehicle can handle all conditions while moving at the speed limit. Even four-wheel and front-wheel drive vehicles can encounter trouble on the winter road and have a difficult time avoiding danger. If you're driving at high speeds in heavy rain, you could hydroplane. In other words, your car could actually lift and travel on a thin layer of water that has formed between the tire and the road. We're not comic book heroes, our cars should not be lifting off the ground! Drive slowly and stay safe.

Pull over and wait it out: Sometimes the fog or rain is just too much to continue driving safely no matter how careful or prepared you are. For your safety and the safety of those around you, it is best to pull off the road and wait until conditions improve. A roadside diner or gas station is a great spot to kill some time while waiting for the weather to improve. If you must stop on the shoulder of the road because you have no other choice, be sure to pull completely off the road and turn off your lights including the brake lights, so that other drivers do not mistake you for a moving car and drive into you.

Deep water: Always use a lower gear if you're driving after a heavy rainstorm or through any kind of deep water. But never drive through water that is more than a few inches deep. If you estimate it will be over the bottom of your vehicle, do not enter it. If it is only a few inches deep, accelerate gently to reduce the chances of stalling. After crossing the water, check the brakes by pressing the brake pedal gently. If the brakes are wet, drive slowly and apply the brakes while having your foot gently on the accelerator. This will dry your brakes after several seconds.

Avoiding and managing skids: Your car can easily skid in icy, snowy, or rainy conditions. You can avoid skidding by decreasing your speed and braking gently. Sometimes, even this might not be enough. Skidding can take you by surprise. Instead of panicking be prepared, use quick judgment and react appropriately. Don't let the skid take control of your vehicle! Instead you should control the skid. Quickly determine which direction the rear of your car is skidding and turn your wheel towards that direction. Pump brakes intermittently and continue to steer in the correct direction to take control.

## CHILD ENDANGERMENT
---
Children are a part of the population most susceptible to physical and emotional harm. For this reason governments pass laws specifically to protect them. These laws are intended to ensure the safety of children, inside and outside the home. Child endangerment laws make it a crime to endanger the health or life of a child through an adult's indifference or carelessness. Some of these laws are intended to protect children while they are riding in cars.

### Before Driving
As children, we all loved to play hide and seek. Some of us played in the house, hiding in closets or even cabinets we could fit in. Some of us played outside, hiding behind trees, parked cars and in garages. Whenever you are about to enter your vehicle and drive off remember to check behind it and around it for children. It's not only the people that you see standing behind the vehicle that you need to be careful of, but also the people you can't see - in this case, children. They could be hiding behind or around a car, getting their ball, or even just walking. Their size makes them especially vulnerable to these senseless collisions. Before driving off, make sure no one is behind or around the car.

### Car Seats
If you have a child as a passenger who is under the age of eight years and under 4 feet 9 inches tall, he or she must be restrained in an appropriate child restraint system in the back seat of the car. There are important exceptions to this rule (covered further in Ch. 11).

### Leaving Children Unattended
Once you reach your destination, never leave a child six years of age or younger unattended in a car, unless there is someone who is at least 12 years old to supervise. This is considered child endangerment and a possible felony. You could be jeopardizing the safety and the life of the child and even others around the vehicle.

When you leave a child in the car, you threaten his or her life. You might think that the child is safe. He or she is locked in the car, safe from any potential predators. You're wrong. In this instance, the car itself can transform into a predator. The temperatures in a car, even on a cool day can be dangerous. A car is a small, enclosed space that traps a lot of heat. Even if you crack open the windows, this is not enough to circulate the air in the car. Don't risk the life of a child. Just take them with you.

A child's own curiosity can also pose a threat. Kids love playing with buttons and knobs. The temptation to touch and press is heightened in adult environments, especially cars. Even if a child has been in a car with you dozens of times, and on each occasion, you've told them that they shouldn't touch anything, once you're away, a child's curiosity can take over. What if he or she shifts the car into neutral? The car would roll away, endangering the child's life and the lives of those around them. Why would you take this chance?

```

1.	When is it ok to leave a child unattended in a car?
NEVER

## DEALING WITH OTHER ROAD USERS
---
Sometimes we forget that people in cars are not the only road users. People can be walking, cycling, or riding motorcycles. We all share the road and should ensure one another's safety. Since cars are the largest and most powerful road users, drivers need to be especially cautious and considerate of other road users.

## Pedestrian Safety
Pedestrians are the most vulnerable and least trained road users. While you are driving in your car, in a relatively safe and protected environment, pedestrians are on the road, without the same protection of a vehicle that you have.  In fact, pedestrian deaths occur in 17% of all traffic fatalities. Drivers have to be especially cautious and considerate of pedestrians.

Different types of pedestrians: Pedestrians are not just adults walking along the street. They include skateboarders and joggers who may suddenly jump onto the street. Pedestrians can be children. They too can be unpredictable. You should watch out for them especially around schools, playgrounds, and residential areas. Contrary to the spontaneity of the children, the elderly and physically or visually impaired take longer deciding and actually crossing the road. Be patient with them.

Some guidelines for sharing the road with pedestrians:

**Pedestrians have the right-of-way in ALL crosswalks - both marked and unmarked.**
- Don't pass a vehicle that has stopped at a crosswalk. A pedestrian you can't see may be crossing the road.  
- Don't stop inside the crosswalk. This is a pedestrian's safe space. By entering this space with your vehicle, you are endangering the pedestrian.  
- Don't forget the importance of eye contact! If a pedestrian has made eye contact with you, he or she is ready to cross the street.

## Bicycle Safety

In many ways, cyclists resemble pedestrians. They're untrained road users and equally vulnerable to the powerful force of a moving vehicle.

Check for cyclists before making turns or lane changes. Remember, it's not just other vehicles that are on the road. A cyclist could be right next to you as you change your lane or when you open your door when you've parked your car. Let them know your position and intentions and learn to anticipate theirs.

They don't take up much space on the road, but that doesn't mean you should crowd around them! Give them plenty of space when passing. Be especially careful when making right turns since bicycle lanes are often located at the far right of the road. Don't get into the bicycle lane until the last 200 feet before the turn. Never try to overtake a cyclist while making your turn! Wait for the cyclist to pass and merge into the lane behind him or her.

> Three Feet for Safety Act (VC 21760)

Starting September 16, 2014, the driver of a motor vehicle overtaking or passing a bicyclist going in the same direction on a highway shall do so at a safe distance that does not interfere with the safety of the bicyclist. The driver must have due regard for the size and speed of the motor vehicle and bicycle, traffic conditions, weather, visibility, and the surface and width of the highway.

He must allow a distance of at least three feet between any part of the vehicle and any part of the bicycle or its operator.

If it is not possible to leave three feet distance because of traffic or roadway conditions, then the driver shall slow to a speed that is reasonable and prudent and may pass only when doing so would not endanger the bicyclist.
If a collision occurs between the driver and the bicyclist and the bicyclist is injured, the driver could be fined $220 if he is found guilty of violating this law.

Helmet Law: California law requires that bicycle riders under the age of 18 wear an approved helmet that is properly fitted and fastened while riding.

## Motorcycle Safety

Just because a motorcyclist is riding a motorized vehicle does not mean he or she is any match for a car. In a sense, they are at greater risk. They might be able to move more quickly than a pedestrian or cyclist but they're still small and less visible. This makes it difficult to determine exactly how fast they're going and how far away they are. You might be tempted to assume their distance and speed but don't take a chance. You should always be extra careful around motorcyclists and be aware of the following:

**Changing lanes**: Just as with cyclists, make sure you watch out for motorcyclists when you change lanes or turn left. They can seem to appear out of nowhere so watch out for them. Keep in mind that turn signals don't turn off automatically on most motorcycles; you must make sure the rider is actually turning before you turn in front of him. He may have forgotten to turn his signal off and doesn't plan on turning.

**Following motorcycles**: Be sure to allow at least a four-second following distance when driving behind a motorcycle. If you follow too closely, you might distract the rider from paying attention to the road. Allow the motorcycle the entire width of the lane. A motorcycle is smaller than a car but for the sake of the rider's safety, you should allow them the entire space. The rider may move around the lane to increase his or her chances of seeing and being seen as well as to avoid obstacles. Just as with cyclists, don't try to overtake a motorcycle in the same lane. If the rider crashes, it's your fault.

### Poor Weather and Road Conditions:
Be extra careful around motorcycles when road conditions are poor. Bad weather, gravel, mud, or ice on the road makes it harder for all road users, but it is even worse for motorcyclists. They don't have the balance and stability of a four-wheeled vehicle and are more likely to skid on slippery roads.

### Instruction Permit: Motorcycle (VC 12509.5)
If you are trying to obtain a motorcycle instruction permit, the law now lays out age-specific requirements. For example, if you are under the age of 21, you must complete the motorcycle safety course administered by the CHP.

**Helmet Law**: California law requires that the driver and passenger of a motorcycle wear an approved helmet that is properly fastened while riding.

Driving is an enormous responsibility. Your safety and the safety of those around you are in your hands. A drowsy bob of the head, a quick turn to the back seat to check on your dog that's running around, or your insistence to drive in bad weather conditions could have horrible repercussions. Don't take unnecessary chances! Don't risk your life or the life of other road users by making bad decisions.

## CHANGING LANES
---
Along with backing up, changing lanes is one of the most used driving maneuvers. Just because we change lanes on a daily basis does not mean it's easy. It can be tricky and dangerous. It's important to know when you can change lanes and how you can change lanes safely. There are a number of reasons why a driver might choose to change lanes:
- You plan to turn at the upcoming intersection and need to get into the appropriate lane.
- The vehicle in front of you is driving slower than the speed limit and you would like to pass them safely.
- Your lane is ending and you need to merge.
- You notice an obstacle or hazard up ahead and would like to avoid it.

If you have to or want to change lanes, plan ahead. Make sure you have ample space to make the change. Check the vehicle ahead of you and the speed of the vehicle behind you. Check for vehicles in the lane you will be entering.
1. Check Mirrors
  Before changing lanes, make sure it's safe to change. Look around you and scan for pedestrians, cyclists, other cars or obstacles that might pose a problem. Use your side and rearview mirrors to check your surroundings.
2. Check Blind Spots
  Checking your mirrors is not enough. Everyone also has two blind spots that are two gaps in our visual field that restrict us from seeing everything. These blind spots are large enough to hide a pedestrian or even another vehicle. The only way you can be sure that it is safe for you to change lanes is to turn your head to the left and right. The side and rearview mirrors are helpful and necessary but they don't reflect the full picture. So turn your head and check your blind spots!
3. Signal
  Once you've checked your mirrors and your blind spots and decided that it's safe to change lanes, you should activate your turn signal continuously for 100 feet before changing lanes. Lights and turn signals are an important means of communication. When you activate your turn signal, you're telling other drivers that you plan to change lanes. Don't just flick it on briefly. Leave your turn signal on until you've successfully changed lanes so that all other road users can see your signal. If you're on the freeway, signal five seconds before changing lanes.
4. Adjust Speed to Enter and Stay
  Re-check your surroundings. Check the space you'll be moving into. You should have enough room to enter without disrupting the flow of traffic. Other cars should not have to slow down, speed up or change lanes because you are entering the lane. If you have decided you have ample room and time, adjust your speed to match the speed of the lane you will be entering. Make the transition as smooth as possible. Don't jerk into the lane! Move into the new lane gradually by moving the steering wheel slightly. Never slow down unnecessarily. This could cause other vehicles behind you to get closer and even cause a collision.
5. Cancel Signal
  After you've changed your lane, maintain your speed and cancel your signal. If you don't cancel your signal, other drivers might think you're planning another lane change. Don't confuse them!

```

1.	What are blind spots?
Gaps in our visual field that restrict us from seeing everything
```
---
## PASSING
---
If you decide to pass a driver, always use good judgment and think and act quickly. You often have a small window of time to pass, so it's essential that you decide the best course and take action. If you are being passed, don't turn into an aggressive driver and speed up. You should do everything you can to avoid a collision and to avoid being caught in one.

### Deciding When It is Safe and Legal to Pass
Before passing, you should remember the rules of passing. Just like any other driving maneuver you should be sure that it is completely safe to pass. Before you pass, take a look ahead and check for road conditions or traffic that may cause other vehicles to move into your lane. If you cannot see far enough ahead, don't take the chance and pass. You don't know what lies ahead or why the other vehicles have slowed down or stopped. It's safer if you wait until you can see ahead. Never drive off the paved road and do not drive on the shoulder to pass. This is dangerous, illegal and can damage your car.

As a general rule, you should pass on the left.  You can pass on the right if:
- you are on a freeway
- the vehicle you're going to pass is making a left
- you are on a one-way road
- you don't drive off the pavement or the main-traveled part of the road

### When You Should NOT Pass
There are many reasons and situations that call for drivers NOT to pass:

- You may not pass other vehicles when approaching within 100 feet of an intersection or railroad crossing.
- You may not pass as you approach a hill or the curve of a road if your view is blocked in a way that would prevent you from seeing an oncoming vehicle.
- You may not pass if your view is blocked as you approach within 100 feet of a bridge, viaduct or tunnel.

But it is also illegal to pass when you simply can't see far enough ahead or do not have enough space to pass or whenever the pass creates a real danger for other road users involved. That is why it is safest to avoid passing unless you have no doubt that it can be done safely.  

One very important situation where you should absolutely never pass is when approaching a school bus with red signal lights flashing.  The flashing red lights tell drivers that the bus is loading or unloading children. And since children can be unpredictable, you have to stop and wait for the bus driver to turn the flashing lights off. Be patient and wait for the flashing lights to stop. Once the lights are off and you begin to drive, do so very carefully. Look around and make sure there aren't any children that might be crossing the road or standing around the bus. You never know when a child may step into the street. You do not have to stop if the bus is on the opposite side of a physical barrier or divider such as a divided highway or multi-lane highway.

### How Do You Decide When It is Safe to Pass?
Before passing you should decide whether or not you can pass safely. First, realize that it will take at least several seconds and several hundred feet (depending on your speed) to pass successfully. Choose to pass only when the oncoming vehicle is more than double this distance from you. As a general rule the oncoming car should be at least 10-12 seconds away - At 55 mph, this is 1600 feet, or 1/3 of a mile. If the car is any closer, trying to make a pass could end up in a head on collision. Check ahead and make sure you can identify an end of pass gap to pull back into. Be mentally prepared for possible problem and have a plan for how you will handle it.



### Steps for Successful Passing
One you've decided it is safe to pass, take the following steps to ensure that you pass safely and successfully.
1. Scan the road: Just as you would for other driving maneuvers, scan the road for hazards. Check the situation of the oncoming vehicles, vehicles approaching from the rear and merging vehicles. Also check your mirrors and left blind spot.

2. Is there enough space ahead? Then determine if you have enough time and space to pass safely. If you are driving 50 to 55 mph, you need a 10-12 second gap in oncoming traffic in order to complete the maneuver. At that speed your car and the oncoming car will each travel 800 feet. So you need at least 1600 feet (1/3 of a mile) between your vehicle and any oncoming vehicle to pass safely. It's difficult to judge the speed of a vehicle that far away because it will look like it is standing still. In fact, if you see it moving closer to you then that should tell you that it is too close for you to start passing. If you have the slightest doubt, do not attempt the pass! Be patient and wait for another opportunity.

3. Make your move quickly: If you feel the situation is safe, activate your signal to show your intent to pass and warn the driver ahead. Accelerate to obtain a speed advantage. Recheck the situation ahead including your blind spot. Steer into the passing lane keeping your eye on the situation ahead and the vehicle you are passing.

4. Return to your lane: Check your rear view mirror. When you are able to see both front tires of the vehicle you are passing, activate your turn signal. Check the blind spot and steer into the right lane without reducing your speed. Turn off your signal and ease off the accelerator to meet the flow of traffic. If another vehicle is passing yours, don't be discourteous and aggressive! Don't speed up, instead maintain or decrease your speed yield to the other driver.


```
TEST YOURSELF:
1.	When considering passing a slow vehicle on a two-way road, how far away should the oncoming vehicle be from you before you make your move?
At least 1600 feet (1/3 of a mile)

## HYDROPLANING

It's a cold, rainy day in California. It's been raining for days and it seems like it's never going to stop. Maria wakes up to the sounds of heavy rain. It's the worst rainfall yet. She thinks to herself, "If I didn't have to go to work, I would stay home. But I have to get to work..." She gets dressed and leaves the house. Maria is a careful driver, especially in poor conditions. Even she can't expect what happens next though. All of a sudden, she feels as though she's flying. It's as though the wheels of the car aren't touching the ground. She quickly realizes what's happening: her car is hydroplaning.

#### What is Hydroplaning?
Hydroplaning can be a frightening experience. It can feel like you've lost control of the car. Your steering wheel will feel loose and your car will begin to slide. When you're hydroplaning, it means that your tires are no longer touching the ground. Your car is floating on top of the water on the road.

#### When Is It Most Likely to Happen?
As we saw with Maria, hydroplaning is most likely to occur if you're driving in heavy rains. It could also happen while you're driving through large puddles. The reason you hydroplane is because there is so much water on the road that your tires can't push through it. It's not just the amount of water though. You are more likely to hydroplane if you are driving fast in these poor road conditions and have worn out tires.

#### How Can You Avoid It?
Hydroplaning can happen anytime the roads are wet. There are some steps you can take however to avoid it. Maintaining your tires is essential to avoiding hydroplaning. Keep your tires inflated properly and ensure that you have good tire tread. If your tires are worn out, replace them! You're more likely to hydroplane if you drive fast. If the roads are wet, slow down and avoid puddles. Finally, try to follow the cars in front of you and drive in their tire tracks. Your tires are more likely to stay in contact with the road if cars in front of you have pushed away some of the water on the road.

#### How Can You Recover?
While following these precautions drastically reduces your likelihood of hydroplaning, it could still happen. If you do hydroplane, don't panic! Do not make any sudden moves such as braking or turning. This could make you skid. Gently ease your foot off the gas until the car slows down. Your tires should touch the road soon thereafter. If you need to brake, do it gently by pumping the brakes.

```
TEST YOURSELF:
1.	What should you do if your car hydroplanes?
Gently ease your foot off the gas until the car slows down. Your tires should touch the road soon thereafter. If you need to brake, do it gently by pumping the brakes.
```

## FISH-TAILING
Imagine you're driving on an icy road and suddenly your car starts shaking and wobbling. The back of your car is skidding to one side! You feel like you have lost control of the car. What's happening?

#### What is Fishtailing?
When you feel like the back of the car is skidding or moving in a different direction from the front of the car, you're fishtailing. This means that the rear wheels have lost traction. You might be able to hear the gas splashing around in the tank. This is scary and dangerous. Not only do you feel like you've lost control but your car could turn around completely or get thrown into oncoming traffic.

#### When Is It Most Likely to Happen?
Since fishtailing happens when your rear wheels lose traction, it's most likely to happen when you are driving on low friction surface such as snow or ice. You are more likely to fishtail if you are driving at high speeds or brake suddenly. If you drive a rear-wheel drive car, you are more likely to fishtail, but front-wheel drive vehicles could fishtail too.

#### How Can You Avoid It?
If you're driving on low friction roads, drive slowly. Do not brake suddenly and take your turns slowly. Just like hydroplaning, it's the rapid movements in bad road conditions that cause you to lose control.

#### How Can You Recover?
If you do fishtail, stay calm and don't overcorrect the problem. Ease off the gas pedal and steer in the direction of the skid. For example, if your rear is skidding to the left steer to the left. Don't steer too far to the left though. This can cause your car to skid in the opposite direction, making your car look like a wriggling fish. As with any other skid, don't brake suddenly. You'll just make it worse! If you fishtail while you're driving in traffic, try to stay away from oncoming traffic by steering the skid to the side of the road, away from traffic.

#### UNEVEN SURFACES
John is driving after some heavy rains. He's glad he was able to avoid driving in bad weather. He didn't have to leave the house that day and decided to stay home instead of risking the possibility of hydroplaning or skidding. He was especially pleased with his decision after he heard what happened to Maria. Once the rains stopped, he decided it was time to go out and run his errands. He had to buy groceries and pick up his dry cleaning. He didn't think he would have to face any obstacles now that the weather had cleared up. Unfortunately, he was wrong. He was driving down his usual path and suddenly felt like his car fell into something. What was that? He pulled over, worried he had a flat tire. He checked his tires and they seemed fine. He then carefully inspected the road and found a huge pothole. A part of the road, already worn from daily use, had sunk in because of the heavy rain and formed a pothole!

While cities and counties try to maintain their roads as much as possible, drivers occasionally encounter uneven surfaces. They may or may not be expecting them. In these instances, drivers may lose control of their cars or damage them. There are a few road conditions that all drivers should be wary of and should know how to maneuver.

### Bad Pavement
Cracks, potholes or patches in the pavement reduce the contact between the tires and the road and may cause you to lose some control of your vehicle. Bad pavement, if driven over in high speeds can also damage your tires and your car's suspensions. You should always be alert when driving. Try to identify bad pavement before you encounter it. Be vigilant especially after heavy rains or snow. These weather conditions are more likely to stress already worn roads, leading to cracks and potholes. Reduce your speed in order to give yourself more time to see and deal with these obstacles. If you can, try to avoid them completely by safely maneuvering around them. If you have to drive over them, brake before your wheels get to the pothole and then release the brake pedal as you are rolling over the pothole. Braking directly over a pothole can seriously damage your car's suspension system.

### DROP-OFFS
Drop-offs are either a small difference in height between the road and the shoulder or a steep cliff. They restrict your ability to swerve onto the shoulder in an emergency or to use the shoulder to park in case of breakdowns.

#### Where Are They?
Anytime a road does not have a "hard" paved shoulder it probably has a drop-off. They can range from a few inches below the road into a large graveled area to 12 inches or more. Rural and mountain areas are most likely to have drop-offs just because of the way the road was created in the land.

#### How Can You Identify Them?
When you are driving on an unfamiliar road, take a quick look to the edge of the road. Is it a drop-off or a hard shoulder? If it's a hard shoulder, it should look the same as the road. In other words, the drop-off and the road will be paved in a similar way. If it does not look like a paved shoulder, you should be careful. The steeper the drop-off, the more careful you should be. If you are driving in a mountainous area for example, you might find yourself driving on the side of a cliff. Don't drive fast! You don't want to lose control of the car! Also, if there is any kind of malfunction with the car, such as a flat tire, you'll have more control of this dangerous situation if you are driving at a slower speed.

#### How Can You Avoid Them?
If you know that the road you will be using has a drop-off, try to find an alternate route. If this is not possible, drive slowly and stay as far away as you can from the edge of the road.

#### How Can You Recover?
You can recover from falling into a small drop-off. It can be tricky however. If there is enough road ahead and the drop-off is not too steep, you can try to accelerate and then turn the tires to get them back on the road. If the tire falls into a larger drop-off, you may need a tow truck to get you out. If it falls off a cliff, your entire car will go down with it.

Drivers can't always see these uneven surfaces and drop-offs. You can combat these road conditions by driving at reduced speeds, especially after bouts of bad weather. Always be mentally prepared for these obstacles. The road is full of unexpected situations.

The best driver is both courteous and experienced. An experienced driver has mastered all of these maneuvers and is prepared for any surprises. If a driver doesn't feel comfortable with any of these maneuvers, he or she should practice them in a safe environment. Mastering these maneuvers will make you an experienced driver and a better road user.

# Chapter 7: Defensive Driving

What is defensive driving? The National Safety Council defines defensive driving as "driving to save lives, time, and money, in spite of the conditions around you and the actions of others." A good driver who has mastered driving maneuvers, is courteous on the road and is familiar with the rules of the road. Drivers trained in defensive driving, however, reduce the risks associated with driving by anticipating dangerous or emergency situations and knowing how to respond to them

#### PLANNING TRIPS
Defensive driving begins before you even get into your car. You should always be prepared for an unexpected emergency or collision. You never know what will happen while you are driving. Take the precautionary steps to ensure that you will be prepared for a variety of situations. Think about your destination. What do you need? Do you know how to get there? Should you write down the directions or program your GPS? Are you worried about the weather? Have you given yourself enough time to reach your destination? It seems like common sense to ask yourself these questions. Oftentimes however we are in a rush to leave and forget to plan ahead. Then we get to a jammed freeway, and scramble to figure out a detour, or realize our car is low on gas miles from a gas station. Give yourself enough time to plan your trips; you'll be better prepared for any surprises the road may have to offer! More importantly, you have the power to decrease the number of surprises you might have to face.

#### Packing
Be prepared! Cars break down all the time. In fact, the Automobile Association of America handles between 29 and 30 million calls every year from drivers stranded on highways. In most instances, it's easy to get help. If you are on a secluded road however this might be a little trickier. It might take some time for help to arrive. If it's late at night places might be closed, making it more difficult to get help. Weather can also play a role in this. If you are stuck in a snowstorm it's unlikely that you'll be able to get help immediately. Don't take a chance! Pack the necessities in an emergency kit and always have it in the car.

Every emergency kit should have a first aid kit, a flashlight, a blanket, a navigation aid, and some warm clothing. If you are stuck in the middle of nowhere in a heavy storm, you want to be sure you can stay warm without the car's heater.

You should also take the additional step and pack some food and water. Obviously, it would be a bad idea to pack sandwiches and fresh food and leave them in your car for an indefinite period of time. What you can do however is pack some energy bars. These high calorie bars provide long-term energy and while not the tastiest foods, they have a long shelf life. You can keep them in your car for months without having to worry about them.

You have the food, but don't forget the water! Up to 60% of the human body is water. While you might be able to survive a few days without food, you can't live without water. Pack a few liter bottles and just leave them in the trunk. If you have a large family or usually travel with many passengers, reconsider your supplies. You don't want to be forced to share that one energy bar among five people because you forgot to pack more.

#### Checking Road Conditions

A defensive driver always anticipates road conditions. While you cannot always predict a traffic jam or a sudden thunderstorm, you can take some measures to better prepare for extreme weather conditions, heavy traffic, or construction.

#### Weather

Mother Nature can be very unpredictable. A clear, beautiful day can transform into a thunderstorm. Who would have guessed it was going to rain? You also can't judge the weather in another part of town. While it might be sunny where you begin your journey, a dark cloud may be looming over your destination, ready to descend. Always check the weather forecast before leaving. Will it be raining? If so, are your windshield wipers in proper working condition? Do you anticipate snow at any point today? Do you have the necessary chains and know how to use them? Sometimes, even meteorologists are wrong about the weather. Checking on the weather report however will still be more accurate than simply looking out of a window!

#### Traffic and Road Construction

Much like weather, traffic jams can be unpredictable. You never know if a collision will back up a freeway for miles. You can however plan your route based on current traffic conditions. You can check for congestion, traffic jams, and road construction by listening to your local news or doing a quick online search. If you can anticipate heavy traffic or construction, you might rethink your plans. Are there any side streets you could use? How about another freeway? Maybe you should leave earlier than you had planned? Planning ahead will also make you a more relaxed driver. If you know to anticipate traffic and plan accordingly, you're less likely to get angry or irritated while driving.


#### Inspect Your Vehicle

If you are planning on taking a long trip whether it's for a few hours or longer, make sure your vehicle is the well-oiled machine it should be! Neglecting to do a basic maintenance check could leave you stranded on the road. The most important areas you should check before taking a trip are engine fluids, radiator hoses, belts, tires and brakes.

- **Engine fluids**: Check your oil levels and the date you are due for another oil change. If it's sometime soon, just change the oil before you leave on your trip. If you do take the car in for an oil change, the mechanic could also check other fluids, such as the transmission fluid.
- **Hoses and belts**: Look under the hood and take a look at the hoses. They play an integral part in keeping your car healthy and running. Do they have any cracks or blisters? If so, it's better to change them than take a chance. You don't want to smell burnt rubber while you are driving in the desert! The same rule applies for belts: if they appear torn or cracked, get them changed before you get on the road.
- **Tire pressure and treading**: Take a look at your tires, give them a gentle kick, and if you have a tire pressure gauge, use it to measure the air pressure of your tires. Are they properly inflated (Remember to check your vehicle's owner manual for the recommended inflation)? While you are checking tire pressure, don't forget to inspect the treading of your tires. Do they look worn? Consider changing them before you head out.
- **Spare tire**: Even though you have checked your tires, the road is full of surprises. What if you drive over a sharp object that deflates a tire? Make sure you have a spare tire. Spare tires can be found in the trunk of a car or might be secured underneath. Check the tire pressure and treads of this tire. A spare tire won't do you much good if it is deflated too! Do you have a wheel wrench and jack? If not, go to the automotive store, pick them up and keep them in the trunk of your car. Even if you don't know how to change a tire, they might be useful to the Good Samaritan that helps you.
- **Brakes**: Healthy brakes and brake fluid are essential for a safe trip. Check your brake fluid. What color is it? Is it the color of maple syrup? If it is, that means the fluid is old and it will start rusting your brakes. Change the fluid or have it changed. Don't forget to check the brakes themselves. If they too are worn, have them changed.

By following these measures, you are sure to have a safer and more relaxing journey. Your car will be less likely to break down, especially because of your carelessness.

## AVOIDING PROBLEMS ON THE ROAD

#### The Importance of a Safe Following Distance
Once you get on the road, maintain a safe following distance between yourself and the car in front of you. A safe following distance allows you to create a buffer zone; if the car in front of you brakes suddenly, you will have enough space to brake without crashing into it. What then is a safe following distance? How are you supposed to determine if you have a sufficient buffer zone?

![](https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Unsafe%20Following%20Distance.jpg)
![](https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Safe%20following%20distance.jpg)
#### Three-Second Rule
If you are driving during the day, on dry roads and in low traffic, you should follow the three-second rule for determining how much space to leave in front. How do you measure three seconds? Choose a fixed object on the road such as a sign or tree. When the vehicle ahead of you passes that object begin counting slowly "one-one thousand; two-one thousand; three-one thousand." Don't cheat and rush with the counting! If you reach the object before you have finished counting, you are following too closely. Slow down and try the count again.

#### Four-Second-Plus Rule
Road conditions always change and a defensive driver knows to adjust his or her strategies to accommodate these changes. What happens to the three-second rule when perfect driving conditions become imperfect? If you are driving in heavy rain, if the roads are wet or slippery, if you are driving in traffic or even if it's just dark outside, you should increase your following distance to four or more seconds. If the weather is particularly poor or there are several factors in play (it is dark out, heavy traffic, etc) then don't hesitate to triple it to nine seconds. For your own safety and for the driver in front of you, ensure that you can brake suddenly without causing a collision.

#### Increase Your Following Distance around Motorcycles
Motorcyclists are more vulnerable than drivers. They don't have the cushioned protection of a car. They have their helmets and that's it. Sometimes it's difficult to gauge if a motorcycle is slowing down. Furthermore, motorcycles are able to stop much more quickly than cars. This means that if you are following a motorcycle too closely, the motorcyclist will have stopped, but you will still be trying to stop. Inevitably, this will lead to a collision which could be fatal for the motorcyclist. For this reason, you should use extra caution when following a motorcycle. Follow at least a four second rule if you are behind a motorcycle. Give yourself enough space to determine if a motorcycle is slowing down. Allow yourself enough space from the motorcycle to even anticipate a stop. By following the four second rule you will have enough time to react to any change in the speed of the motorcycle.

Maintaining a safe following distance is the key to being a defensive driver and a good driver. Following a car closely will not help you reach your destination any faster. It will just aggravate the driver in front of you and endanger you and other road users.

### Avoid Driving in Someone's Blind Spot
There are two areas around your vehicle that you cannot see called blind spots. These are very dangerous areas! It's important to check your own blind spots before changing lanes since other vehicles could be driving in them without being seen. If cars could be hiding accidentally in your blind spots, you too could be hiding unintentionally in another car's blind spots. A defensive driver will take that extra step and stay out of other drivers' blind spots. The other driver may not turn his or her head as they should and end up hitting you while switching lanes. Either slow down or speed up so you are not driving right next to any cars.

![](https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Another's%20blind%20spot.jpg)

Driving right next to other cars also poses another problem: it doesn't give you the opportunity to maneuver in case of an emergency. Imagine you are driving on the freeway and a large cardboard box is flying at your car. Your only option is to swerve out of your lane. If you have decided to drive in bunches with other vehicles, you can't go anywhere. You are forced to drive ahead, slow down, and hope that you win this game of chicken with the box. Whether it's following the three-second rule or ensuring that you are not driving in clusters of traffic, always allow yourself room to maneuver. This way, you will be prepared for the unexpected.

### _Be Prepared to Escape a Problem_
Pablo and John are driving on the freeway, on their way home from the beach. They spent all day at Santa Monica with a group of friends. While everyone else decided to leave earlier, John and Pablo being good defensive drivers decided to wait for traffic to calm down. They know that you are less likely to get into a collision if you avoid rush hour. Once they left the beach, traffic was significantly better, however, there were still quite a few cars on the road. John was driving. He not only followed the three-second-plus rule (it was dark, after all) but he also kept looking around, making sure he wasn't in anyone's blind spot. After driving for fifteen minutes, they noticed that a car was approaching them rapidly. Both John and Pablo knew that tailgating was a problem especially on the freeway. They both assumed that was all it was, a stubborn tailgater refusing to abide by the three-second rule. After looking up at the car again, they noticed he was right behind them and did not seem to be slowing down. Was there something wrong with his brakes? Or was this an example of road rage? Whatever it was, they did not want to find out how far this would go. The other driver was approaching them too quickly. John quickly signaled that he would change lanes, checked his mirrors, looked both ways and switched lanes. This evasive action saved John and Pablo from a dangerous collision.

A defensive driver is always prepared to escape a sudden problem or obstacle.   In this case, the threat came from behind the car. In most cases, however, drivers must be prepared for what lies ahead or next to them. What should you do if a driver stops suddenly? If you are alert enough and have given yourself enough space, then you should be able to brake as well. But what if you can't? You must think and act quickly. Your other option is to switch lanes. This of course is only possible if you are not driving directly alongside other vehicles. Evasive actions require fast thinking and fast acting. They also require you to plan ahead. In other words, to maintain a safe following distance and plan a set of escape routes all around you. If John had decided to drive alongside other cars on the freeway, he would not have had room to switch lanes and the car behind him may have crashed into him. John however is a defensive driver. Even though he did not expect such an incident, he prepared ahead. He gave himself a number of escape routes, in anticipation of such a hazard. Even if you don't think you'll need this escape plan, always have one ready and be ready to implement it. You never know what lies ahead or even what might be coming up from behind you!

#### Increase Your Car's Visibility: Drive with Your Headlights on during the Day

![](https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/daytime%20headlights.jpg)

One of the easiest ways you can avoid a collision is by making sure that other drivers and road users can see you. It is every driver's responsibility to look around and check for other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and obstacles. But it is also every driver's responsibility to make sure they can be seen. All cars are equipped with lighting to help drivers see and make sure the vehicle can be seen by others. You should use the headlights when it is cloudy, foggy, raining or snowing, on frosty mornings when other drivers' windows may be icy or foggy, and on small country or mountain roads. You should use headlights any time you have trouble seeing other cars because they're probably having trouble seeing you too! In fact, the law requires you to turn on your headlights whenever weather conditions prevent you from clearly seeing a person or other motor vehicle on the highway from a distance of 1000 feet, or when driving in conditions that require your windshield wipers to be in continuous use.

What about when you are driving during the day? It's another beautiful, sunny day in California. Do you need to use headlights? Can everyone see you? They can, but with all the other things they are looking at, they might not pay enough attention to your car. After a while, your car could look like it's blending into the background. Having your headlights on just adds an extra layer to the scene to call attention to yourself. Even though the law does not require it, it is a good idea to drive with your headlights on all the time, even on sunny days. This will help other drivers see you and may help you avoid a head-on collision. But don't forget to turn them off when you park!

#### Avoid Lane Changes near Intersections
Intersections are the most dangerous areas of the highway system. They are defined as any location where two roads cross or join. The right-of-way rules must be applied at these crossroads. There are two kinds of intersections: controlled and uncontrolled. Controlled intersections have signs or signals posted or a traffic control officer to control the flow of traffic and help determine the right-of-way. Uncontrolled intersections do not have signs, signals or a traffic control officer directing the flow of traffic.

Whether intersections are controlled or not, they are the centers of much activity. It is at the intersection where oncoming cars will be turning left, where cars in your lane will be turning right and where some cars will attempt u-turns. For this reason, it is best to avoid lane changes in or near intersections. These are already dangerous situations. Do not add another element of danger. Changing lanes near an intersection can lead to a misunderstanding among drivers. A driver planning to make a left turn has scanned the road for hazards. He or she assumes that drivers approaching the intersection will stay in their lanes until after they have passed the intersection. In most cases, they decide whether or not they can turn safely based on this assumption. If you decide to change lanes just as you approach the intersection, or even worse in the intersection, you are confusing the other driver. This could cause a collision. Instead of endangering yourself and others, wait to pass the intersection then change lanes.

#### Scanning for Hazards
You can easily avoid problems and collisions on the road by carefully looking all around your car (scanning) for hazards. By looking far enough ahead and keeping your eyes moving, you are able to anticipate any problems and give yourself more time to deal with them. In order to scan the road fully, you should repeat these steps:

1. When looking ahead, don't just stare at the car in front of you. Aim your gaze around 10 to 15 seconds ahead so you can see problems with enough time to decide what to do. Do you see brake lights up ahead, even before the car in front of you brakes? You can start slowing down and preparing your next move.  
2. Use your peripheral vision to scan the sides of your car. Your peripheral vision will help you determine if a car is trying to switch lanes or if any sudden changes have taken place around you.  
3. Use your mirrors to help you see what's happening behind you and around you. Is a car speeding toward you? Should you change lanes?  
4. Repeat the above steps until you arrive at your destination.    

#### LOOK OUT FOR: Parked Vehicles Moving into Traffic
It happens so often. You are driving and all of a sudden a car jumps in front of you. Where did it come from? If you did not see a car exit a driveway, then that leaves only one other alternative: the car was parked. It's common sense that the driver of a parked car will eventually return to his or her car and get back on the road. These cars don't stay parked forever! Yet they continue to surprise other drivers. A defensive driver will scan the road for just such a hazard. As you are driving, continue to look ahead. Take advantage of your peripheral vision as well, which allows you to see out of the corner of your eye. Are any drivers entering their parked cars? They might be unlocking their car doors to retrieve something; or they might be getting ready to leave. This should be enough of a clue that a new car will be merging with traffic. Just to be safe pass this car slowly. Brake lights are also a big clue. The driver might have just pulled into a parking spot; or he might have just turned his car on and is preparing to join the road.

If you are driving in the lane closest to the parked cars, regularly scan the road for these signs. Is anyone entering a parked vehicle? Were brake lights or turn signals activated in a parked vehicle? These are clear signs that a parked car may soon merge with traffic. If you see these signs, slowdown in case a car does pull out in front of you. If a car has activated their turn signal, be courteous and let them merge. Don't be aggressive and hog the road. This is not only rude but it can also be dangerous. You properly scanned the road and anticipated this car's intentions. The driver behind you might not have been so diligent and might have missed the signals. If you don't allow the car to merge, the driver might try to merge behind you and crash into the car behind you. You might get caught in a collision you could have easily prevented.

LOOK OUT FOR: Vehicles Taking Your Right-of-Way at Intersections
Another common hazard is a vehicle that is taking your right-of-way at an intersection. There is a set of right-of-way rules that all vehicles should follow. By doing so you decrease the likelihood of a collision.

- A vehicle going straight has the right-of-way over a vehicle turning left.
- A vehicle with a left turn arrow (a type of protected turn, discussed further in Ch. 12) has the right-of-way over a vehicle going straight.
- A vehicle already in the intersection has the right-of-way over other vehicles just getting there.
- At a 4-way stop ( a type of controlled intersection, discussed further in Ch. 12), the driver reaching the intersection first gets to go first.
- When two or more cars arrive at an intersection at the same time, the right-of-way should be given to the car on the right.
- At an intersection where there are no traffic signs or signals (an uncontrolled intersection, discussed further in Ch. 12), the vehicle on your right has the right-of-way and should go first.
- Vehicles entering a main road from a minor road, private road or driveway must yield to all traffic and pedestrians on the main road.

These laws are intended to clarify any confusion at an intersection. Unfortunately, some road users might overlook these right-of-way laws or simply forget. Imagine you are the first to reach a four-stop intersection. Another car drives up to the intersection a few seconds after you. You are about to step on the gas pedal when you realize that the other driver has decided to start accelerating. Instead of accelerating yourself, yield to the other driver. Even though you do have the right-of-way, the other driver has refused to grant it to you. Don't risk a collision to prove a point! Since you were scanning the road, you noticed the other driver accelerating. If you were not using this defensive driving technique, you could have risked a collision. Defensive driving coupled with common sense saved you from a crash!

#### LOOK OUT FOR: Inattentive Driver or Erratic Driving
In many senses, the greatest hazards are inattentive drivers or those driving erratically. Inattentive drivers are most often distracted drivers. These are the drivers who are fiddling with the radio or their GPS. They might be daydreaming about the rest of their day, about a trip they have planned or about what they are going to have for lunch. Obviously, these thoughts are not more important than the task at hand - driving. If you are a skilled driver you can easily spot an inattentive or distracted driver. These drivers might make unsafe turns or nearly run red lights. Since they are distracted, they are not scanning the road for potential hazards. They might not notice a car pulling out of a parking spot. They might miss that palm tree branch that broke off last night. A defensive driver will notice these signs and try to avoid the distracted driver. If he or she didn't see that huge tree branch, how do you know he or she will see you when you try to switch lanes? Avoid these drivers. Don't try to drive behind them or in front of them. If you are driving behind them, you might want to consider changing lanes. They might finally notice an obstacle and brake without any warning. You could then be responsible for rear-ending the other driver. Avoid driving next to them as well. The distracted driver might decide to swerve to avoid something on the road, but forget to scan the area for other drivers. Driving in close proximity to these drivers is a hazard. You have already seen that they are not paying attention. Avoid these drivers as you would any other hazard.

While some drivers are distracted others might be erratic. By definition, erratic drivers are unpredictable. They are most often under the influence of a substance, be it drugs or alcohol. This is a terrifying possibility: an intoxicated person in charge of a ton of metal, glass, and plastic. Scan the road for these drivers, especially if you are driving late at night. Erratic drivers tend to swerve in and out of lanes for no apparent reason. They might also be driving well-below or well-above the speed limit. Remember, their ability to sense speed is distorted. They might be driving well-below the speed limit, thinking they are being inconspicuous. Also keep in mind that erratic drivers, particularly intoxicated ones, have a slow reaction time. If they come across a hazard, they might brake a few seconds too late or swerve into an adjacent lane to prevent a collision. They are not going to be alert and might collide into the vehicle next to them. In many ways, these drivers are worse than inattentive drivers because they are under the influence of a substance. It is physically and biologically impossible for them to react to other hazards in an appropriate time frame. While an inattentive driver might "wake up" after a near-collision incident, intoxicated drivers cannot. If you are driving behind or in front of one of these drivers, change lanes. If possible, pull aside and call 911 to report the erratic driver. He or she is risking the safety and life of all road users.

#### WHAT TO DO? Scan for Hazards before Making Lane Changes
If there are hazards while you are driving in your own lane, you have to be even more cautious when switching lanes. Changing lanes is one of the most common driving maneuvers but also one of the most dangerous. If you have to switch lanes to avoid a hazard, scan the other lanes for potential hazards too. Make sure you're not going to cut anyone off when you do switch lanes. Don't become a hazard for other drivers!

Pablo is driving down the freeway and as we have seen he can be a careless driver. It's not on purpose, he's just easily distracted. At one point he decides he needs to change lanes. He looks in his rearview mirror and his side mirrors, but forgets to check his blindspots. He begins to veer into the next lane when a car starts honking at him. If the other driver had not been alert and scanning for hazards, there could have been a collision! Scanning the road is crucial when changing lanes. You don't want to be the hazard on the road! You also want to avoid potential hazards such as speeding cars. Before you change lanes always check your mirrors and your blindspots. Remember, if a car is right next to you the only way you can see it is if you turn your head. As we saw with Pablo, the mirrors are essential but never enough. Don't simply rely on your mirrors! A defensive driver can anticipate hazards but also avoids being the hazard herself.

```

Don't try to drive behind them or in front of them. If you are driving behind them, you might want to consider changing lanes. They might finally notice an obstacle and brake without any warning. You could then be responsible for rear-ending the other driver. Avoid driving next to them as well.
```

#### WHAT TO DO? Cover the Brake
When we think about driving, we usually think about moving and reaching our destination. This, of course, is done by pressing the gas pedal. Naturally, we know we will brake but usually at red lights or stop signs. Defensive driving however should be a fine balance consisting of braking, accelerating and covering the brake. **What is "covering the brake?" Covering the brake means holding your foot above the brake pedal, without actually touching it, in case you need to brake.** You obviously don't need to cover the brake the entire time you are driving. You do have to accelerate to move!

When you approach an intersection however you should always cover the brake. Intersections are the most dangerous areas of the road. Imagine you are driving on a two way road. You approach an intersection where your light is green and instead of covering the brake, you continue at the same speed. Suddenly, a car from the opposite side decides to make a left turn, directly in front of you. You have to slow down! If your foot isn't already covering the brake, you may not have enough time to slow down to avoid a collision. While the other driver should have been more cautious with his or her turn, you could have avoided the problem by being prepared with your foot covering the brake. Every time you approach an intersection, reduce your speed and scan the intersection left, center and right before crossing. It doesn't matter if the intersection is controlled or not. Stay safe! Don't rely on traffic lights, traffic signs and other drivers respecting these lights and signs.

Not only should you cover the brake when approaching an intersection, but anytime you see a hazard up ahead. Maria's adventures on the road offer the perfect example. Maria is on her way to visit John. As she's driving, she notices a cat scurrying across the road in the distance. She does what most drivers would do. She covers the brake and prepares to stop. The cat reaches the other side of the street and Maria returns to her normal speed. Maria knows that if she recognizes a hazard she should cover the brake. Defensive drivers not only scan for confused animals, but for all hazards. What is the point of scanning the road for hazards if you are not going to slow down? Sometimes you can switch lanes, but other times you can't. What if there is a car in the lane right next to you? If you don't have an escape route, you have no choice but to slow down or stop. As soon as you recognize a hazard, cover the brake! Be ready to slow down and when that is not enough, to stop.

#### Using Modern Technology to be a Better Driver
All drivers rely on their senses and on their good judgment to drive well. Modern technology however has introduced some great aids. These aids are especially useful in helping drivers see better. Don't hesitate to use these aids! There are limitations to what the human body can do, but these aids help diminish them.

##### Sunglasses
While sunglasses are not an invention of the 21st century, they have dramatically improved over time. Over the years, the lenses have become clearer allowing for greater visual clarity and comfort. Why use them while driving? Sunglasses are more than just fashion accessories. They are wonderful and simple driving aids. When driving on a bright day, the rays from the sun could feel as though they are blinding. Bright sunlight can hinder your ability to drive safely. The glare from the sun could prohibit you from seeing oncoming traffic, traffic control devices and especially pedestrians. Wearing sunglasses will help reduce this temporary blindness.
##### Auto Designed Water Repellent on the Windshield
Traditionally, when drivers saw drops of rain, they would switch on their windshield wipers. Some windshield wipers worked better than others. Windshield wipers could become a problem if you had not washed your car in some time. Windows can be dirtier and grimier than they appear in dry weather. Once it starts raining, you can see the dirt rolling down. If you activate your windshield wipers when the windows are dirty, you will spread the grime and make it harder to see. As windshield wipers are not equally effective, people started considering alternatives. One such alternative became the water repellent. What is a water repellent? Just as its name implies, it's a product that repels water. It coats a car's windshield so that it becomes a very smooth surface; so smooth that water beads and rolls off. If you activate your windshield wipers, however, they can create a mist behind the blade. Generally, water repellents are a great aid to help you see better in the rain.
#### Convex and Panoramic Mirrors
All cars come equipped with rearview mirrors and passenger-side mirrors. They have been installed by manufacturers to help you see better, however they also create two areas known as blind spots - those areas around your car that you cannot see. Two recent innovations can help reduce and possibly eliminate these blind spots.  

##### Convex mirrors:
Convex mirrors or wide angle mirrors virtually eliminate blind spots. They are especially useful when you are passing or changing lanes. Even if your car does not come equipped with convex mirrors, you can easily install one. Most automobile parts stores will have a variety of convex mirrors to choose from. Pick one that will fit on your existing mirror. In most cases, all you need to install the convex mirror is some double-sided tape. If you do choose to install a convex mirror, be careful! These mirrors have distorting effects on distance perception. "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear"!

##### Panoramic Mirrors:
Panoramic rear-view mirrors eliminate all blind spots. Just like panoramic pictures, these mirrors give you a wider range of vision, allowing you to see everything that is happening behind you and beside you. Similar to convex mirrors, panoramic rear-view mirrors are easy to install. You can find them at most auto supply stores and all you need to do is clip them on your present mirror.

##### Audible Back-up Warning Devices
Driving aids are now audible as well! When backing up, it can be difficult to gauge how far or how close an object is. It's also difficult for a driver to determine if a new object has appeared behind the car. A good driver will check behind the car before backing up, but there is still a gap between checking and starting to back up. Another object or even a person, especially a child, has the opportunity to run behind a car. Can you ever be sure that the path is safe and clear? Until recently, the only way you could ensure an absolutely safe path was if a passenger was guiding you. In recent years, many car companies have added another feature to their cars. Some newer cars come equipped with audible back-up warning devices. These devices use radar technology to detect obstacles behind a vehicle. The devices start beeping if the vehicle gets too close to an object. These driving aids reduce the chances of any unfortunate collisions, be it colliding into a person or bumping into a car parked behind you. If your car does not come with this device, there are some devices that can be purchased and installed.

### Knowing When to Give Up your Right-of-way
Right-of-way rules try to simplify the concept of "right-of-way" into "black and white," easy to understand situations. They tell us which car should go and which car should wait. But even with all those rules, right-of-way situations still have a lot of gray area that is based on the driver's point of view. The way one driver sees a situation makes it obvious to him that he should go ahead, and the way the other driver sees the situation makes it clear to her that she should go through. They can't both go through. So what do you do when you find yourself in this kind of situation?

Keep in mind that the ultimate goal when driving is not about being right or proving that the other driver was wrong. The goal is to avoid all collisions and keep everyone safe, even if it means giving up your right-of-way. Does it seem unfair to give up your well deserved right-of-way to another driver? Well think about it this way: Who cares if you are right, if you end up in a crash to prove it? What if you or your loved one died in a crash because you insisted you were right and forced your way through a situation when the other driver was not giving you the right-of-way? Does it still seem unfair?

Let's go through some common situations and examine how you can decide when it is not worth fighting for your right-of-way. Do these sound familiar?

1. As you approach a construction zone ahead, you attempt to merge into the lane next to you in the standard alternating from each lane method, but the driver that is supposed to give you the right-of-way, insists on going ahead. We suggest that you let him go, and don't get angry about it.  Save your energy for more important problems.
2. As your signal light turns green and you prepare to move forward, you see several cars that are still trying to make a left turn on the red. Inconsiderate and stupid? Yes! Should you barrel through the intersection because you have a green light? No! Charging at them will either guarantee a crash or the start of an angry fight with another driver. Let them continue; it will only take a few seconds.
3. A pedestrian crosses the road in front of you with no regard to the nearby crosswalk or your approaching vehicle. It's technically your right-of-way. But should you take it? Absolutely not! How will you explain to the officer your reason for hitting the pedestrian? What if the pedestrian dies?
4. You are trying to exit your driveway, which is on a busy street. Legally there is no law that stops you from exiting the driveway and making a left turn, but traffic is always bumper to bumper in the morning and nobody is giving you the right-of-way to cross the lanes and make your turn. Should you inch your way forward and insist that traffic stops so you can make your turn? Not a good idea. Even if it seems unfair for you to lose the ability to make your turn, you have to consider the difficulty of the situation and find a way to enter traffic and go to the right (a much easier move) and go around the block.


Driving is a social situation where black and white rules don't always solve the situation or tell the full story. What would you do if a very large group of people with guns were walking down the street towards you and didn't bother to move over to allow you room to pass by? Would you stand your ground, insisting that you pass, and risk conflict with the armed bandits? Or would you move over and patiently wait for them to pass?

Next time you find yourself in a situation where another driver is not giving you the right-of-way (even though the rules say he has to), imagine that the other driver is that armed group of people, and let it go. You get to avoid a crash, continue with your day and go home to tell your family and friends about the crazy and rude driver you escaped. Doesn't that sound better than telling them how you insisted on taking the right-of-way, as you lay in your hospital bed or in court?

Defensive drivers take the necessary steps to anticipate road conditions and the movements of other drivers. These drivers are prepared for almost any situation and they are ready to deal with the unexpected. By using defensive driving techniques you can reduce your chances of a collision. Defensive drivers are also the ideal road users. The measures they take preserve not just their own safety but also the safety of those around them.

# Chapter 8: Collision Avoidance

In states such as California, where there is not much of a public transportation system, most people spend a big portion of their day driving.  In these states, the number of collisions can be higher. While it's impossible to stop all collisions from happening, there are ways to decrease the number of collisions and your chances of being involved in one. Don't be a statistic!

#### Collision Statistics
Collision statistics show some promising overall trends. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the number of collision related fatalities in 2011 is significantly lower than 2003. But at the same time, there is a slight increase in 2012.

Experts believe the overall decrease can be attributed to tougher seatbelt, drunk driving and other laws. It is too soon to understand the cause of this sudden increase after so many years of steady decreases. Is it an ominous trend in progress or strange coincidence? Regardless, in 2012 an average of 93 people died each day in a car crash; that is one every 16 minutes. While this is still an improvement over the previous decade, these numbers mean that the road remains a dangerous place.

(Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts 2014)

#### California
California is experiencing a similar trend. In 1995 there were 4192 collision deaths, but only 2816 in 2011. Unfortunately, in 2012 the death toll had increased by 1%. That is 41 more of our friends, family and neighbors that died that year than the year before with a total of 2,857.

(Source: CHP, Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System, 2014)

#### Type of Violation

- Alcohol and Drugs (DUI): Year after year hundreds are killed by people driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It is, in fact, the leading cause of traffic fatalities. In 2003, 1,010 people were killed. The number steadily decreased every year until it reached 477deaths and 12,567 injuries in 2010. But in 2011 it was back up to 539 deaths. Injuries continued to decrease slight at 12,347 in 2011. DUI remains the number one cause of traffic fatalities in California.  
- Right-of-way: Whether drivers don't understand or knowingly don't follow right-of-way rules, such as who should go first at a four-way stop, a minor collision is almost sure to follow. The good news is that right-of-way collisions are less deadly than the other top violations, but they did cause the second most injuries in 2011; 29,239 injuries total. That's double the injuries caused by DUI.
- Improper Turns: You might not think making an improper turn would be big contributing factor to collisions, but the statistics show otherwise. Improper turns, such as unsafe left or right turns or making a turn from the wrong lane, account for the second most number of deaths and the greatest number of injuries. In 2011, for example, 526 people were killed and 21,617 people were injured because a driver made an improper turn.  
- Speeding: Driving at unsafe speeds is another, less surprising factor causing collisions. In 2011, 410 people were killed as a result of speeding and 48,272 people were injured. That makes it the #1 cause of car crash injuries.

#### Time of Day
Statistics also illustrate that the highest number of collisions is related directly to the number of vehicles on the road. You are more likely to get into a collision if there are more vehicles that you can collide with. Generally, there are fewer people driving in the very early hours of the morning, such as 4am. This is also when you see the least number of collisions. More people are out on the road on the weekends and it should come as no surprise that most collisions occur on weekends. The additional challenge of driving on the weekends is that you are more likely to encounter a drunk driver. All of this contributes to the number of fatalities each month. Statistics also show that even the time of year can determine the number of traffic collision fatalities. In 2011, for example, there were more fatal collisions in California in May, July and September than in any other time of the year. These months have warm weather but also they have the Memorial Day, 4th of July and Labor Day holidays, all of which see an increase in drinking and driving.

(Source: CHP, Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System 2013)

#### Age Groups
Particular age groups are also more likely to be driving when a collision occurs. Drivers between the ages of 20-24 are more likely to be drivers in fatal collisions. One might think that it would be drivers who just got their license, but that is not the case. It might be that the first age group of 15-19 is more cautious as new drivers. After a few years of driving, however, these drivers appear to become over-confident and reckless. We also have to consider the impact that alcohol must have. It is when a driver is in this age group that he or she can legally drink. With little experience drinking and understanding drinking limits, they are more likely to get behind the wheel after a long night of drinking and socializing.

(Source: CHP, Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System 2013)

#### Gender
Even gender appears to determine who is more likely to be involved in collisions. Although the difference is slight, the numbers illustrate that more male drivers are involved in collisions than female drivers. It's only in drivers over 80 that more females are involved in collisions. Furthermore, if a collision does take place, more male drivers are killed than female drivers. The reasons behind this gender difference remain unclear. It might be that male drivers are more aggressive and willing to take chances with their driving. It could be that they are more likely to stay out socializing with friends and drive home either tired or under the influence. Whatever the case might be, it calls for male drivers to be more cautious.

(Source: CHP, Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System 2013)

#### Personal Liability Immunity (Health and Safety Code 1799.102)
A good Samaritan who offers medical or non-medical care in a responsible manner at the scene of an emergency cannot be sued for any liable damages.

### United States
Fatalities due to traffic collisions have decreased overall not just in California but in the United States as a whole. While some of this is due to a greater awareness of road rules, this positive shift in the statistics can also be attributed to the dramatic increase in the use of seat belts. The NHTSA estimates that in 2013, 87% of the population used seat belts. They also estimated that over 12,000 lives were saved because of seat belt use. Furthermore, over half of the people who were killed in traffic collisions in 2012 might have survived if they had been wearing seat belts. These statistics highlight the importance of being properly belted while in a moving car. But just as in California, questions remain. What is the cause of so many of these collisions? Who is more likely to be involved in these collisions?

(Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2014)

### Type of Violation
DUI and speeding: In 2011, speeding was a major factor in all collisions where at least one person died. In fact, 31% of all fatal crashes can be blamed on speeding. Translated into the number of human lives, this means almost 11,000 people were killed because of a speeding driver in the United States. The NTHSA has also determined that there is a relationship between speeding and driving under the influence. In 2011, 42% of speeding drivers who were involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol content of .08 or higher. What does this mean? Drivers who have been drinking are more likely to speed and then cause a deadly crash because of it.

(Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2013)   

#### Distracted Driving:
According to www.distraction.gov, distracted driving was also another huge factor in collisions. At any given daylight moment in the US, approximately 660,000 drivers are using cell phones or manipulating electronic devices while driving. Despite cell phone and texting laws, this hasn't changed since 2010 (www.distraction.gov).

10% of all fatal collisions and 17% of injury collisions could be blamed on distracted driving. This means that more than 3300 people were killed and 387,000 were injured because a driver was doing more than just driving. About 12% of these deaths (385) are because at least one of the drivers was using a cell phone. Drivers in their 20s are most likely to drive while distracted. In 2011, 27% of distracted drivers in fatal crashes were in this age group. (Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2013)
#### Time of Day
Just like California, most collisions in the United States happen in the warmer months when people drive more. In 2012, there were more crashes in August than in any other month. One might assume that December or January would have the highest numbers because of the winter holidays and poor weather. However, year after year, August proves to be the most dangerous month to drive in the US. It should come as little surprise though that the most dangerous time of day to drive is between midnight and 3am, on a Saturday or Sunday. It's during the weekends that most people go out to socialize and it's during the weekends that more people are likely to drive under the influence of a substance, thus increasing the likelihood of a collision.

(Source: NHTSA FARS database, 2014)

#### Age Groups
Driving-related fatalities have had some devastating effects on the younger portion of the population. Much of this is related to the inexperience and foolish boldness of younger drivers. Some of this is alcohol-related though. You must be 21 to drink legally in all 50 states, yet in 2012 28% of young drivers killed in crashes had a blood alcohol concentration of .01 or more. This number should be 0! Once someone has started drinking, especially someone from this inexperienced age group, they are less likely to wear seat belts once they get into a vehicle, thus decreasing their chances of survival if they are involved in a car crash.

(Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2014)

While these younger drivers are a problem, it is the age groups above them that are a more serious concern. In 2012, 29% of the drivers involved in fatal crashes were between 25-34 years old- the highest percentage from all age groups. Even more specifically, drivers between the age of 21 and 24 were more likely to be involved in an alcohol related fatal crash than any other age group. They were responsible for 32% of all alcohol related fatal crashes. (NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2014)

On the other end of the spectrum, older drivers (all drivers above the age of 65) appear to be the safest drivers. Older drivers had the lowest involvement rate (17%) in fatal crashes per population as compared to other driver age groups and the lowest rate (7%) of alcohol related crashes as well. Most traffic fatalities involving older drivers in 2012 occurred during the daytime (75%), occurred on weekdays (69%), and involved other vehicles (64%). This could be because older drivers drive slower and more cautiously than younger drivers who can be impatient and aggressive with the older drivers. (Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2014)

#### Gender
According to the NHTSA, young male drivers continue to be the most reckless drivers. In 2012, 37% of both 15-20 year old and 21-24 year old males who were involved in fatal crashes were speeding. In contrast, only 24% of 15-20 year old females and 19% of 21-24 year old females in fatal crashes were speeding. This difference between the genders stays true regardless of the age group. So even gender plays a part in the likelihood of collisions. (Source: NHTSA Traffic Safety Facts, 2014)

These numbers can be shocking and frightening, but there are steps you can take to avoid collisions. Don't become a statistic!

TEST YOURSELF
1.	Which drivers are most likely to be in a deadly crash?
Young Male Drivers
```

What causes all these collisions? There are a variety of reasons, but common collisions happen because drivers think certain violations are not "a big deal." Others may not understand the laws or just don't know the law exists.

### _Unsafe Speed_
The NHTSA has conducted a number of surveys and it appears that drivers have a lax approach to speeding. Many drivers seem to think they are in a better position to judge the proper speed limit. In other words, 75% of drivers admitted to driving over the speed limit because they thought it was safe.

(Source: NTSA, National Survey of Speeding and Unsafe Driving Attitudes and Behaviors: 2002)

#### What Is an Unsafe Speed?
California’s Basic Speed Law says that anytime you are driving faster than the conditions allow, you are driving at an unsafe speed. For example, even if the speed limit is 55mph, you should be driving slower if it’s raining. The posted speed limit is meant for perfect weather, road and driving situations. If you are driving in traffic, if visibility is low, the weather conditions or the roads are poor, you are expected to slow down. You can be cited for driving “too fast for conditions” even if you are driving at the speed limit in these conditions.  


#### Speed Limits for Designated Areas
As you probably have already noticed, different areas of the highway system require different speed limits for everyone’s safety. Places that have a high concentration of slow pedestrians have a much lower speed limit than an area with no pedestrians and no traffic lights. Traffic safety experts have taken into consideration all these factors and have devised special speed regulations for the following areas:

#### Freeways:
Freeways were designed to handle traffic of higher speeds. However, since you are sharing the freeway with others you must remember that some vehicles are not able to move as fast as others. If very high speeds were permitted for cars and other vehicles drove at much slower speeds, the risk of collisions would increase. So a maximum speed that makes all of the different vehicles capable of sharing the same road without conflict must be the posted limit. The maximum speed limit on most California freeways is 65 mph. On some highways the maximum speed limit varies from 55 to 70 mph. Always pay attention to the posted speed limit.

#### Two-lane Undivided Highways:
The maximum speed limit is 55 mph unless the posted speed limit shows otherwise.

#### Residential Zones:
Because of the large number of pedestrians in residential zones the maximum speed limit ("Prime Facie") is 25 mph.

#### Business Districts:
Also, because of the large number of pedestrians the maximum speed limit ("Prime Facie") is 25 mph.

#### School Zones:
Always drive more carefully near schools, playgrounds, and parks because children may suddenly dart into the street. Near a school, the speed limit is 25 mph while children are outside or crossing the street. No matter what the speed limit sign states, you should never drive faster than 25 mph when the school ground has no fence and children are outside.

#### Senior Areas:
Certain areas around senior citizen centers or senior activity centers may be marked with a “Senior” warning sign. You must obey a 25 mph speed limit in these areas.

#### Uncontrolled Blind Intersections:
Uncontrolled blind intersections are those where you cannot see for 100 feet in either direction (left or right) during the last 100 feet before crossing including alleys. As you approach an uncontrolled blind intersection the speed limit is reduced to 15 mph. You must also reduce your speed to 15 mph when you approach within 100 feet of a railroad crossing when you cannot see 400 feet in both directions (left or right).

#### Speed Limits for Designated Vehicles
Some vehicles are required to observe a lower speed limit of 55 mph on highways. Three or more axle trucks, a vehicle hauling a trailer or towing another vehicle, a school bus transporting students, a farm labor vehicle transporting passengers or a vehicle transporting explosives all have to obey a reduced speed limit. These vehicles are also required to use designated lanes when such lanes are available or the right hand lane when these lanes are not available. It is important not to be upset by their reduced speed and instead try to work with them. They may have to further reduce their speed in certain circumstances such as hills.

### _Driving Too Slow_
Driving at an unsafe speed does not apply to speeding alone. The Minimum Speed Law tells us that driving too slow is also dangerous and illegal! You could become an obstacle to other drivers and cause a collision. If you insist on driving slower than the traffic around you, you must drive in the farthest right lane.

### _Speed and Stopping Distance_
While stopping time may seem short, when you consider the fact that you are often traveling at great speeds, total stopping distance is actually rather long. The time it takes to see the danger depends on your mental and physical state, how far ahead you are scanning the road and how quickly you identify the danger. If all factors are at their best, it will take 3/4 of a second to see the danger and make a decision. Acting on your decision requires another 3/4 of a second. It will take a total of 1 1/2 seconds for you to start reducing your speed. This could take much longer depending on the driver.

Total stopping distance is the distance you will travel from the moment the hazard appears until your vehicle comes to a complete stop. For your vehicle to come to a complete stop, it will have traveled a certain distance. Your experience and skill in braking, the mechanical condition of the vehicle, road conditions and your speed are all factors in determining this distance. The most important factor, however, is your speed. If you double your speed, the braking distance is quadrupled. This means that it will take four times the distance to stop your car. If you don't have that much room in front of you, then a crash is impossible to avoid. Give yourself the time and space to react to an obstacle or hazard.

#### How Does Speed Affect a Crash?
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the higher the speed you are traveling, the greater the risk of serious injury or death in a crash. Vehicles and their occupants in motion have kinetic energy that is released in a crash. This release of energy happens when the car hits another object, the occupants hit the inside of the car, and their organs hit the inside of their chest wall. The greater the energy that must be released, the greater the chances of severe injury or death.

How speed affects a crash:

- It increases the distance a vehicle travels from when a driver detects an emergency until the driver reacts.
- It increases the distance needed to stop a vehicle once an emergency is perceived.
- Crash severity increases with speed. For example, when speed increases from 40 to 60 mph, speed goes up 50 percent while the energy released in a crash more than doubles.
- Higher crash speeds reduce the ability of vehicles, restraint systems, and roadway hardware such as guardrails, barriers, and impact attenuators to protect occupants.

### Driving On the Wrong Side of the Road
It might seem obvious, but driving on the wrong side of the road automatically puts you in hazards way. Most drivers end up in the wrong lane because they are trying to pass another vehicle or have made some error while making a turn. These are mistakes that can be easily avoided.

#### Passing
If you are trying to pass another car, you can legally drive on the other side of the road, but only for a brief time. Always keep in mind that this is a risky move! Make sure you have at least 10-12 seconds of space between your car and the oncoming car before attempting to pass. And of course, never try to pass in areas where passing is completely illegal such as railroad tracks and blind curves, etc. (Discussed further in Ch. 6 and Ch. 12).

#### Entering a Left Turn Lane Too Early
If you enter the left turn lane too early, you could find yourself driving on the wrong side of the street. Don't enter the left turn lane until you see the markings. Otherwise you can get into a head-on collision with an oncoming car.

#### Cutting the Corner on a Left Turn
When you are making a left turn, don't turn too soon and cut the corner of the lane for oncoming traffic. By doing so, you are driving on the wrong side of the road and could end up in a head on collision.

#### Other Factors
While trying to pass or making a left turn might be the most common reasons for driving on the wrong side of the road, other factors might also lead to this dangerous mistake. If you are drowsy, driving under the influence of a substance, or distracted, such as by turning back to discipline your child, you could get into a collision. Remain alert!

```
TEST YOURSELF What is this?
1.	Early & Aggressive left turn tactis is an example of driving on the wrong side of the road.
```

### _Improper Turns_
Many crashes happen because of improper turning. Follow the basic procedures for turning to avoid a collision. First, plan your turn ahead of time. Signal 100ft before making the turn. Reduce your speed and check your mirrors and blind spots. Turn only when it's safe. Are you correctly judging the distance between yourself and the oncoming car? How about your distance from the pedestrian? Don't take unnecessary risks! If you see a Do Not Turn sign, don't turn!

#### Right Turns
You can avoid a collision easily on a right turn. Always give the right-of-way to pedestrians. Obey the No Right Turn on Red signs. If you come across one of these signs, don't take the turn, even if you don't see any traffic. The sign has been posted for a reason; obey it.

#### Left Turns
If you are making a left turn, always give the right-of-way to pedestrians crossing on a green. Check the other side of the road to ensure that pedestrians aren't crossing before you make the turn. Make sure that you are properly gauging the distance between yourself and the oncoming car. A car might approach you faster than you think. Make sure that the turn is safe before you start. If a car is making a right on the other side of the road, they have the right-of-way. Yield to the cars turning right. Only make your turn when you are confident you will avoid a collision, either with a pedestrian or another car.

#### U-turns
Avoiding illegal u-turns is one of the easiest ways to avoid a collision. Perfectly legal u-turns are already tricky maneuvers. They require skill and experience to be completed successfully and safely. Illegal u-turns, however, are even more dangerous. Many drivers make illegal u-turns in the middle of business districts, unaware that these turns are illegal. Remember, these are already busy and congested roads. A u-turn here could be deadly. Another common mistake made by drivers is making a u-turn in front of a fire station or using the fire station driveway to make a turn. This endangers the firefighters who are racing to reach the emergency, the people who are in an emergency and yourself

#### Other Places Where U-turns are Illegal
- At or on a railroad crossing
- On a divided highway by crossing a dividing section, curb, strip of land, or two sets of double yellow lines
- Where you cannot see clearly 200 feet in each direction because of a curve, hill, rain, fog, or other reason
- Where a “No U-Turn” sign is posted
- When other vehicles may hit you
- On a one-way street
- In front of a fire station or on the fire station driveway
- In business districts. Areas with churches, apartments, multiple dwelling houses, clubs, and public buildings (except schools) are also considered to be business districts. Turn only at an intersection, unless a sign prohibits it, or where openings are provided for turns

### Violating Right-of-way Rules
Right-of-way rules are an integral part of the road. They are key to understanding the "rules of the game." Because of right-of-way rules, drivers can anticipate other drivers' actions. Will the car to my right move before I do? Should I yield to that driver? Without right-of-way rules, drivers would have to deal with chaotic and confusing roads. It is no wonder then that collisions occur when people are not aware of the right-of-way rules or simply refuse to follow them.

Drivers should also remember that abiding by the right-of-way rules does not only mean you let a pedestrian cross or you respect a bicycle lane. You might yield to these road users, but if you pass a stop sign without stopping you are not respecting another driver's right-of-way. By obeying all the signs and signals you are following ALL the rules of the game. Remember, everyone has to follow all the rules, all the time, in order for this game to work.

#### Pedestrians
Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. Pedestrians account for 17% of all traffic fatalities. Everyone using any kind of vehicle, be it a car, a motorcycle or a bicycle should respect a pedestrian's right-of-way. If you are making a right turn, always make sure the pedestrian has safely reached the other side of the street before making the turn. Don't inch up next to them hoping they'll walk faster or hoping you'll make that turn a few seconds earlier. And do not stop in the crosswalk. That is the pedestrian's safety zone. That ton of metal, glass, and plastic you are maneuvering can have a devastating impact on a pedestrian.

Remember that pedestrians have the right-of-way when crossing at corners or other crosswalks, even if the crosswalk is in the middle of the block. This also applies to street corners with or without traffic lights, and whether or not the crosswalks are marked by painted lines. You must stop for them and allow them to safely cross before moving. Be especially careful when you are exiting a driveway. Creep up to the sidewalk slowly. You never know when somebody might be jogging by or when a skateboarder might come jetting in front of you. If you quickly emerge out of the driveway onto the sidewalk you could easily miss these pedestrians and collide into them. At best, these pedestrians could suffer injuries or depending on your speed, they could be killed.  

#### Intersections
More than 45% of all collisions occur in intersections. Furthermore, intersection collisions account for 21% of traffic fatalities. Signals and signs are in place but they are obviously being overlooked or ignored by a portion of the population. Consider an intersection with a four-way stop sign. If a driver is unaware of the right-of-way rule, he or she might stop briefly and continue driving, even if other cars are already at the intersection. Another driver who had first reached the intersection would have correctly assumed that he or she had the right-of-way and drive into the intersection. Unless one of these two drivers was cautious and alert, a collision could happen. Since intersections are so complicated, drivers can only avoid collisions by following the right-of-way rules.   

(Source: http://dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/right_of_way.htm)

#### Other Right-of-way Situations
There are numerous other right-of-way situations that require drivers to follow these rules to avoid devastating collisions. Not knowing or following the right-of-way rules regarding school buses could have the most horrific outcome. Remember, if you approach a school bus with flashing red lights, you have to STOP unless you are on the opposite side of a physical barrier or divider such as a divided highway or multi-lane highway. The flashing red lights mean that passengers, most often children, are getting on or off the bus. If a driver overlooks these lights or forgets to stop, he or she could easily hit a child, seriously injuring or even killing the child (Discussed further in Ch. 12).

```

### Stop Signs and Signals
How often has this happened to you? You are driving down a residential street. You're in a hurry or are simply feeling lazy. You approach a stop sign, brake a little, but decide to keep driving instead of stopping completely. You think to yourself: "I know this street. There's never anyone driving on this street. If someone does approach the intersection, they should be driving slowly. I'll be able to see them and stop if I have to. Why bother stopping?"

Stop signs are not a suggestion; they are a rule! Even if the stop sign is in a quiet residential neighborhood, you have to stop! You might think you can see all the traffic that is at the intersection or approaching the intersection. You never know when another vehicle might come speeding through the intersection (just like you). Or what if another vehicle has stopped a few feet behind the line and you can't see them until it's too late? If you don't stop you could be involved in a head-on collision.

#### Purpose of Stops
Stops and traffic signals are not arbitrary additions to the road. Traffic engineers take many factors into consideration when they decide to add a stop sign or traffic sign to an intersection. They chart and analyze the amount of traffic going through a particular intersection. They also assess a driver's visibility at the intersection. Are there many large, old trees interfering with the visibility of a corner? Well, the solution is not to cut down every tree at every intersection in California. The stop sign is intended to ensure that all drivers at that particular intersection have a chance to see and be seen. Right-of-way rules then guide drivers as to when they should drive ahead. In order for the stop sign to serve its purpose, you must stop completely!

#### Rolling Stops
What is a rolling stop? A rolling stop happens when a vehicle does not stop all the way at a stop sign or signal, but instead rolls through. Just because you don't see another car, doesn't mean one isn't there. The only way you can be sure, and in fact the only way you can avoid a collision, is if you come to a complete stop. There is a reason why traffic engineers decided to place that stop sign there. Don't try to find out why by rolling through the stop and getting into a collision!

#### Running a Yellow or Red Light
It happens so often. You are approaching an intersection and the light turns yellow. Do you stop or do you go? You should always think about safety first. You should always try to stop at a yellow light. Just as you are eager to get through that intersection once the light has turned yellow, other drivers are eager to drive ahead once their light turns green. This is a recipe for disaster. If you still have some distance before you actually reach the intersection, stop. Don't think that you will "make the light". What if someone equally anxious to get through is waiting on the other side? You will find yourself involved in a collision that you could have easily avoided.

#### Distracted Driving
Just because the law only prohibits cell phone use and texting does not mean that other distractions are safe. Any time you spend looking away from the road increases your chances of a collision. Even if you are not doing anything else, something like drowsiness could have deadly results. For those couple of seconds that you shut your eyes, you could end up driving on the wrong side of the road and into oncoming traffic. Always stay alert and do not multitask. You are sitting behind the wheel to drive, not to do anything else. In 2013, the NHTSA listed distracted driving as the cause of 17% of all injury collisions. Don't join this 17%!

# Chapter 9: Road Rage and Aggressive Driving

John is having one of those days; everything is going wrong. Before leaving for work, he spilled coffee on his new shirt. Busy with changing into a clean shirt, he forgot about an important meeting at work and arrived too late. Early in the afternoon he received a phone call from his son's school, informing him that his son was misbehaving in class. What else could go wrong? By 5pm John is ready to leave and get home. Unfortunately, it's not going to be that easy. There was a collision on the freeway and the roads are jammed up. He gets off the on-ramp and quickly discovers that this is going to take a very long time. As soon as he gets on, an aggressive driver cuts him off. John starts getting agitated. As more time passes, he becomes increasingly frustrated. He starts honking his horn at everyone who tries to change their lane around him. He is reluctant to let anyone pass.  He is cursing, making gestures, and making an already bad situation worse. Fortunately, John realizes that he is overreacting and calms down before his aggressive driving escalates. Who was the problem in this scenario? John and his aggressive driving are one problem, but so is the other aggressive driver who is cutting him off. What's the difference between the two? There really is no difference; they are both guilty of aggressive driving.

#### WHAT IS AGGRESSIVE DRIVING?
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration defines aggressive driving as "when individuals commit a combination of moving traffic offenses so as to endanger other persons or property." Speeding, tailgating (following too closely), erratic and sudden lane changes, and failing to obey traffic signs and signals are all examples of aggressive driving. Both John and the other driver in the examples above are driving aggressively.

#### WHAT IS ROAD RAGE?
Unlike aggressive driving, road rage is a criminal offense and a form of assault. Road rage is attempting to injure or kill another driver because of an incident on the road. Road rage became a problem in the United States in the 1980s, with the increasing road congestion. Some people actually got out of their cars and started fighting or shooting each other on a regular basis! If the situation with John escalated to the point that he followed the other driver and tried to harm him or put him in danger it would be considered road rage.

(Source: AAA Foundation Aggressive Driving Study)

#### Faces of Road Rage
In Seattle, Washington, Terrance Milton Hall, age 57, shot and killed Steven Burgess, a 21-year-old college student, because Burgess couldn't disarm the loud anti-theft alarm on his jeep.

In the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in April of 1996, Narkey Keval Terry and Billy Canipe, both 26, began dueling in their cars as they drove up the George Washington Parkway. Traveling at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour, the cars crossed the median of the parkway and hit two oncoming vehicles. Only one of the four drivers involved in the crash survived; Terry was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the incident.

In October of 1999, a Las Vegas woman was indicted after she allegedly cut off a tractor-trailer that was driving too slow, and then slammed on her brakes. A motorcyclist following that truck crashed into it and died of massive head injuries.

In February of 2000, an unidentified man got out of his car after a fender bender in San Jose, California. He approached the other driver, reached inside her car, grabbed her dog and threw it into oncoming traffic. The dog was run over and killed.

Even people you would never expect to behave like this have been known to commit road rage. In California, Oscar winner Jack Nicholson believed that the driver of a Mercedes-Benz cut him off in traffic. The 57-year-old actor grabbed a golf club, stepped out of his car at a red light, and repeatedly struck the windshield and roof of the Mercedes.

In 1995, Robin Ficker, 52, a prominent Maryland lawyer and former Maryland state legislator, was driving his two sons to see his ailing father at Holy Cross Hospital. Suddenly Ficker's 1990 Jeep Cherokee bumped into a newer model Jeep in front of him. The driver, Caroline Goldman, was six months pregnant. Goldman reported that when she approached Ficker's car he became very agitated, pointing at her and yelling. "He seemed to be out of control," she said, and reported that Ficker struck her in the face, breaking her prescription sunglasses and giving her a black eye that lasted for ten days. Ficker was convicted of battery and malicious destruction of property.

In Massachusetts, Donald Graham, a 54-year-old church deacon, saw Michael Blodgett, 42, flash his high beams at another car and didn't like it. The two antagonized each other as Graham chased Blodgett's car for seven miles on Interstate 95. When the men finally pulled off the freeway and got out of their vehicles, Graham retrieved a crossbow from his trunk and shot Blodgett in the chest. Blodgett bled to death; Graham was sentenced to life in prison.

As you can see from these examples, the slightest mistake can trigger road rage. Sometimes it's triggered by minor driving errors such as forgetting to signal before turning. Some causes of road rage then are misunderstandings between drivers. One driver might think that the other driver deliberately didn't signal before he turned, when in fact it was just a mistake. You might be thinking, "That would never happen to me." Don't be so sure. How often do you find yourself weaving through traffic because you're late for an important event? You justify your actions by telling yourself that you have no choice; you cannot be late. Drivers around you don't know what your situation is or what you're thinking. You could be racing to get to the hospital, but to them it looks like you have no respect for the road or other road users. You could anger someone who is frustrated already with his or her day. This could trigger thoughts and behaviors they would not normally have and even escalate into road rage.

It's not only other drivers who can overreact. How many times do you find yourself thinking another driver is a rude or selfish driver? How often do you react to these thoughts? Once you start having these thoughts, any situation could transform them into something much worse. If someone cuts you off, do you take it personally and try to "teach him a lesson"? You could act on these thoughts and turn into the "road rager." If you expect sympathy and understanding from other drivers, you should extend them the same courtesy.

#### California's Road Rage Law
Situations like this happen all the time and you should avoid them at all costs. Road rage incidents are so common that the state of California passed a set of laws to address this problem. If you are convicted of assaulting a person with a car, you can be imprisoned for one to four years, fined up to $10,000, or both. The court can also suspend your license. For a first time road rage offense, your license can be suspended for six months. If you are convicted for subsequent offences, your license could be suspended for one year. Additionally, the court may order you to complete an anger management course.

### AVOID AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVING SITUATION

Every time you get in a car, you might encounter an aggressive driving situation. Sometimes you might be the victim, and other times you might even become the aggressive driver. There are steps you can take to avoid these situations.

#### Avoid Rush Hour
If you are someone with a particularly bad temper, you should avoid driving during rush hour. If you're having a bad day or feel especially irritable, take some time to calm down. Don't get behind the wheel. You never know what could happen if you're already feeling frustrated and then find yourself sitting in traffic. Don't give yourself the opportunity to find out what you are capable of!

#### Give Yourself Time
Allow yourself plenty of time to reach your destination especially if you are driving to an important event or meeting. Nothing can be more aggravating than sitting in traffic when you know you have to be somewhere.

Even if you are running late, don't turn into a rude driver. Don't cut off other drivers. Imagine you were in a coffee shop, waiting in line to order your afternoon coffee. You have a meeting in a few minutes and the line is reaching the door. Would you just cut in front of the line? No. Then why even consider it on the road? Furthermore, you don't know the other driver's emotional state. Don't become a trigger that might set off road rage!

#### Drive in the Appropriate Lane
If you know you are a slower driver, don't get in the fast lane (the farthest left lane). Everybody in the left lane assumes they will be driving a little faster than the rest of traffic. Switching into the left lane and then driving slowly is going to irritate other road users. Be considerate and switch into another lane. This not only helps other drivers who drive at a different speed, but it's also safer for everyone on the road.

#### Don't Follow Too Closely
Tailgating is one of the most irritating things a driver can do. When you tailgate, it means you think the other driver is driving too slowly. Do you actually think driving a couple inches behind them will make them drive faster? How do you feel when someone tailgates you? Does it make you speed up, or does it make you angry and annoyed.  Remember, treat others the way you want to be treated.

When you are driving that close to the car in front of you, you could make the other driver nervous. He or she might think, "What if he hits me when I stop?" If the flow of traffic changes and you are tailgating, you might not have enough time to stop suddenly and safely, hitting the car in front of you. The other driver, becoming increasingly anxious, might give you a taste of your own medicine and slow down or make sudden stops. This doesn't help anyone. It increases the chances of a collision and aggravates both drivers. If you would like to be driving faster, simply change your lane.

#### Don't Make Gestures
Do you regularly make gestures at people while you're walking down the street or while you're shopping? Then why would you make them while you're in your car? Walking, shopping and driving are all social situations and you should behave with the same level of courtesy in all social situations. Just because you're in your car does not mean you can make rude gestures freely. If you think you can because you feel safer in your car than walking down the street, you're wrong. Your car does not offer you the safety or the right to be rude. Any situation could escalate rapidly and you could find yourself at the receiving end of an aggressive situation.

#### Don't Use the Horn as a Weapon
When you're in a car, rude gestures can be made with your hands but also with your horn. The purpose of your horn is to warn other drivers of an emergency or to inform them of your presence. You should not be pounding on the horn because you're annoyed with another driver, you want them to drive faster or you want them to get out of the way. Consider the noise that a horn makes. It can be grating on the ears and upset even those drivers who were calm prior to then. Apart from the noise pollution, unnecessary use of the horn can trigger road rage.


```
TEST YOURSELF What is this?
1.	What can you do to lessen the chances of being in an aggressive driving situation?
Give yourself time, avoid rush hour, don't follow, choose right lane, no gestures, less horn.
```

### CONTROL YOUR OWN EMOTIONS

#### Avoid Situations You Can't Handle
If you are someone with a bad temper, avoid driving during rush hour. Traffic can be frustrating for even the calmest drivers, but for those with a temper it can be disastrous. And always give yourself more time to reach your destination. You're less likely to get aggravated if you're not in a hurry. It might also prevent you from blowing up if someone does cut you off.

#### Relax
If you do find yourself getting agitated, try some techniques to calm down. Deep breathing is proven to help calm nerves. Another relaxation technique is to breathe in counting to five, then breathe out counting to five. This forces you to regulate the rate at which you breathe and is guaranteed to slow down your heart rate.

#### Give Them the Benefit of the Doubt
Always give other drivers the benefit of the doubt. Remember the last time you cut someone off? Was it deliberate or was it a mistake? In most of these situations, drivers misunderstand one another and because they can't verbally communicate while they are in their cars, the situation escalates. In almost every instance, the other driver did not mean to offend you so don't overreact.

### DEALING WITH AGGRESSIVE DRIVERS

If you find yourself coming across an aggressive driver on the road, there are some measures you can take to avoid a confrontation.

#### Avoid Eye Contact
Avoid making contact with the aggressive driver. Even if he or she appears to be getting more aggressive, do not make eye contact. By acknowledging the driver or their actions you could aggravate the situation even more. The driver can also misunderstand eye contact for a challenge. Just don't look them in the eye! It may seem cowardly, but is this worth fighting for?

#### Do NOT Engage with the Aggressive Driver
If the situation does worsen, don't argue with the aggressive driver. He or she is ready to blow up. You want to avoid it, and more importantly, you don't want to become a trigger. Arguing with aggressive drivers or even engaging them can rapidly worsen the situation.

#### Leave Plenty of Space
Give the angry driver plenty of space. Don't tailgate and don't cut him or her off. Remember, road rage is a consequence of congestion. Don't further cramp into the angry driver's space by allowing only a few inches between yourself and the driver.

Encountering someone with road rage can be a frightening and dangerous situation. It might be even more frightening if you see yourself turning into a "road rager." If you find yourself getting angry take some measures to calm down and avoid a traumatic event. If you come across an aggressive driver on the road, take the necessary measures to stay out of their way. Our daily lives can be very stressful and driving often just adds to this stress. Don't turn into another factor that already contributes to this stressful task. Stay calm, stay considerate, and give other drivers the benefit of the doubt.

# Chapter 10: Driving Distractions
### WHAT IS DISTRACTED DRIVING?

Distracted driving is driving while doing other, non-driving activities at the same time. It means that you are not giving driving your full attention, thus increasing your chances of a collision. The US Department of Transportation lists three types of distractions:

-  Visual distraction: taking your EYES off the road
-  Manual distraction: taking your HANDS off the wheel
-  Cognitive Distraction: taking your MIND off driving

(Source: US Government website for Distracted Driving)

Think of your brain as a computer. If you open too many applications at once, it starts running slowly. It takes longer to open a document or close a browser because you've given it too much to do at the same time. Your brain works in the same way. If you are doing anything else while driving, your brain is weighed down with too many activities. It means that you are doing each activity more slowly and it's going to take you longer to react to any change on the road. A pedestrian could step off the sidewalk or another car could change its lane. If you're distracted, you could miss the pedestrian or the car and get into a horrible collision.

![](https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Computer.jpg)

We usually think of cell phones as the worst kind of distraction and this is true. Texting in particular is by far the most dangerous since it combines all three types of distractions - visual, manual, and cognitive. Even if you're just talking on the phone, using a hands-free set, your mind is still distracted and you put yourself and others at risk.

```

### DISTRACTED DRIVING STATISTICS
Many people think that they can handle multi-tasking, especially when it comes to driving and cell phones. But here are some statistics that prove otherwise.

- Using a cell phone while driving, whether it's hand-held or hands-free, delays a driver's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit of .08 percent. (Source: University of Utah)
- Drivers who use hand-held devices are four times as likely to get into crashes serious enough to injure themselves. (Source: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety)
- In 2009, 5,474 people were killed in U.S. roadways and an estimated additional 448,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes that were reported to have involved distracted driving. (Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: FARS and GES)

These statistics are frightening and there is no doubt that using a cell phone significantly impacts your ability to drive well. Instead of taking your chances on the road, wouldn't it be better to just make your phone calls once you've stopped driving? Even if you think you can talk or text while driving, the law now says that you can't.

#### CELL PHONE AND TEXTING LAWS
Since cell phones and especially texting are such hazards, the State of California has passed some laws to deal with these problems. Here are a few laws you should know regarding texting and using a cell phone while driving.

- As of July 1, 2008 it is illegal to talk on a handheld cell phone while driving. If you are over 18, you may use a hands-free device while driving. If you are under 18, you cannot talk on any wireless device, handheld or hands-free. The law makes an exception for emergency situations.
- As of January 1, 2013 it is illegal to write, send, or read text messages or emails while operating a motor vehicle, unless the electronic wireless communications device is specifically designed and configured to allow voice-operated and hands-free operation to dictate, send, or listen to a text or email, and it is used in that manner while driving. Entering or selecting a telephone number or name into the device for the purpose of making or receiving a phone call or activating or deactivating a feature or function on the device is considered exempt from this law.

Even though hands-free sets are legal, they are still a distraction, so it's best to leave all phone calls for when you have pulled over. If we think about the brain as a computer, talking and driving are two very big applications running at the same time. When using a hands-free set, both hands are free for the steering wheel but your mind is still distracted. You could be making plans and daydreaming about what you're going to be doing that evening or arguing with customer service about a credit card bill you know you paid on time. It doesn't matter who you're talking to, talking on a cell phone means you are trying to carry on a conversation and drive at the same time, forcing your brain to work slowly. This means you will react more slowly to the unexpected conditions of the road than you would if you were only driving.

#### Television Broadcast or Video Signal (VC 27602)
With this law, you can drive a car with a television receiver, video monitor, television or video screen, or any other similar visual displayer as long as the equipment is designed, operated and configured in such a way that the driver cannot view the broadcast or video and not be distracted.

```

### NOT JUST ABOUT CELL PHONES
Cell phones are not the only things that can distract us while driving. While they are one of the most obvious causes of collisions, there are other distractions that can lead to collisions. For the most part, we create these distractions, especially the ones in the car, or allow ourselves to get distracted by what is happening outside.

#### Dashboard Electronics
While cell phones are the most hazardous electronic devices used in the car, the car itself is most often equipped with a variety of gadgets. These electronics, however, offer us another opportunity to do anything but drive. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are a great way to ensure that you don't get lost. Your GPS will tell you where to turn left or right, where to get on and off a highway, saving you from the anxiety of feeling lost or actually getting lost. The GPS might calm the nerves of many drivers but navigation systems are also a huge problem on the road. Oftentimes drivers change destinations while driving or ask for the system to "re-calculate," which draws the driver's attention away from the road and onto the dashboard.

Dashboard electronics are not restricted to these navigation devices. Many of the buttons and knobs on the dashboard are also there to make your experience in the car as pleasant as possible. Controlling the music and the temperature in the car means that you will have a comfortable drive. We all know, however, how annoying the radio can be sometimes, playing songs you don't want to hear, or maybe even hate, almost forcing you to reach over and change the station. By taking that time to look down, reach for the knob or button, and surf the radio, change a track on a CD, or skip a song on a portable media player like an iPod or MP3, you increase your chances of getting into a collision. Is it worth it to get into a collision because you don't like a song you're hearing?

Similarly, no one likes to be in the car if it's too hot or too cold inside. You should try to turn on the air conditioner or heater before you start driving. If it does get too cold or too hot, just wait until a normal stop such as a red light to change the temperature.

Let's turn to our companions, Pablo and Maria, to illustrate some of these points. Pablo can be a careless driver. He is easily distracted and always has to make sure he is absolutely comfortable while driving. This means he changes radio stations and keeps changing the temperature in the car. For Pablo, it's either never cold enough or never hot enough and he's always confident he can find better music if he just keeps looking. He's been driving like this for years and has almost gotten into a collision on numerous occasions. Since it hasn't happened yet, he thinks it won't happen.

One afternoon, Pablo picked up Maria to go to the movies. As soon as Maria was in the car she noticed that he was once again changing radio stations, putting the air conditioner on low then on high, incapable of keeping his eyes on the road. While driving during rush hour, on one of the busiest freeways, Pablo was looking down to adjust the temperature in the car. Traffic was moving and he didn't think anything would change during that second he was looking down. But it did. All of a sudden the car in front of him came to a stop. Maria screeched and he immediately stopped. Thanks to Maria's caution he avoided a collision by a few inches. Maria was obviously very upset and barely stopped herself from yelling at Pablo. Instead, she sternly suggested that when she's in the car, he should tell her (or whoever is in the passenger's seat) to fiddle with the music or temperature controls rather than doing it himself. If he's not driving with any passengers, shouldn't he just wait until he comes to a normal stop? Is it worth getting into a collision because he needs to change the temperature to make it "perfect" or to change the music?

#### Other Passengers
In this instance the passenger, Maria, was helpful to the driver. Without her, Pablo would have hit the car in front of them. Maria also offered some useful suggestions for safer driving. In other instances, however, other passengers can be an additional distraction. When you're driving with friends and relatives it's important to keep your passengers under control and to keep your attention on the road. They can distract you by talking loudly or arguing with one another or even with you. You should remind your passengers from the start that they should try to be helpful as passengers (such as by changing music and regulating the temperature in the car) rather than being disruptive. If they do start arguing with one another or with you, don't get involved and don't get distracted by it! You can continue an argument or a discussion once you've pulled over and stopped driving. Always remember that there's a psychological aspect to driving too. If you get upset or angry while driving, this will impact your ability to drive well.
Friends and relatives aren't the only kinds of passengers though. Children and pets can also be passengers and in some instances can be even more distracting than adults.

#### Children
Before you take children in the car with you, make it very clear to them that driving is a serious and important job. Teach them that while they are in the car they should buckle their seat belts. Remind them that you have to concentrate when you're driving so they shouldn't argue or fight with one another while they are in the car. They should stay in their seats and play a game or read a book, quietly entertaining themselves and allowing you to focus on driving.

#### Pets
Many people love to drive with their dogs on their laps or running loose in the car. While it's always nice to see a happy dog with its head out the window and ears flapping, this is also very dangerous. You should always secure your pet in a carrier or harness. If your pet is loose in the car, or worse, sitting on your lap, both you and the pet are in danger. Instead of worrying as to where your pet has gone in the car or what it is doing, secure your pet and focus on the road.

You should think of yourself as the captain of your ship. You are in charge of your vessel and all the other members of your crew, be they other adults, children, or pets. For the sake of your safety and that of your passengers, you should make sure you have control and that you have established rules for the ship

### Eating
We all have very busy lives. Sometimes we rush out early in the morning to get to work, with no chance to eat breakfast or drink coffee. After a while, this begins to take a toll on our bodies. We are not as alert as we should be when we get to work or even on our way to work. A good breakfast is necessary to kick start your day. It will get your mind and body working properly for work. We all know this, which is why we all make our morning coffee and bagel stops. This however becomes a problem when you're driving. It's become a habit with many people to eat and sip while driving. You may think that this isn't a problem or a distraction. Let's consider some of the things involved in eating and drinking. The first thing you have to do is reach for the food. As we've seen with the electronics on the dashboard, this can be a brief but dangerous distraction. Once you have your food in your hands, you have to unwrap it if it's wrapped or remove it from its container or box. This forces you to use your hands to get to the food instead of keeping your hands on the steering wheel. What if you drop what you're eating? How can you pick it up and clean yourself up while driving safely?

You may think a drink, whether it's hot or cold, might be safer than eating. After all, all you have to do is put the cup to your lips and sip or put the straw to your mouth. That can't be too difficult, right? Even drinking a soda or a coffee is a distraction. Remember, every time you are doing something that takes your attention away from driving, even if it's for a split second, you are forcing your brain to multi-task. Your brain will not only think about driving but also about getting your mouth to the straw so that you can sip that soda. This might not seem like a big deal, but it's still a distraction. There's also the possibility that you might spill some of your drink. There's nothing worse than spilling hot coffee all over yourself. We all know that those coffee cup lids can be tricky. Sometimes there are no problems whereas other times the lid is not on properly or it somehow spills. Maybe you can ensure that you don't have a knee jerk reaction when you spill some soda on yourself, but what about hot coffee? It's nearly impossible not to react at least by slightly jumping out of your seat. This can be extremely dangerous. Not only will you try to clean the mess and soak up the hot coffee, but you might even lift your leg off the gas or brake pedal, coming close to or getting into a collision. That sip of coffee can end up costing you thousands of dollars.

The best way to avoid these collisions or near-collision experiences is to just eat and drink when you are not driving. Either pull over for a few minutes or wait until you get to your destination.

#### Personal Grooming

We all want to look "put together" before we get out of the house. Whether this involves shaving or applying makeup, we try to look our best. Just like that elusive breakfast, sometimes we run out of time to get ready. We dress ourselves and rush out, thinking we can take care of the rest of it in the car. The car is not an extension of your bathroom where you can groom yourself. Grooming in particular requires attention to a lot of detail. Whether you are shaving or applying makeup, you have to pay close attention to what you're doing. You don't want to miss a spot while shaving or apply lipstick to somewhere other than your lips. If you are trying to do all this in the car it is inevitable that you are distracted. You are most likely only looking in your rearview mirror, not at what's happening in front of you. And even though you are looking in your rearview mirror, you are not even paying attention to what is happening behind you, just to your face. By the time you apply that lipstick or shave that unseemly patch of hair off your face and look down, you could be too late to stop from getting into a collision. Instead, plan ahead and make sure you finish all your grooming at home instead of relying on your time in the car to get this done. You'll probably look much better if you apply your makeup or shave when you're not operating a moving vehicle!

Always remember, your car is a very different space from your home. You can multi-task at home without it being a serious threat or danger to yourself or those around you. Your house is not on wheels and in motion with you steering it in one direction or another; it's stationary. If you choose to do multiple chores at once, you can. If you spill something, you can easily wipe it clean without worrying about a deadly collision. When you're in your home, you can easily read the newspaper or chat on the phone while sipping your coffee. You don't have to worry about anything else. Another car will not hit you nor will you hit another car. You can't collide with a pedestrian or run over someone's pet. So just do all these things before you get in the car. Your car is not an extension of your home or office. It's not the place to finish what you couldn't finish at home or at work.

#### Scenery and Window Shopping
Maria and John love to drive along the coast on the weekends. The Pacific Coast Highway, with its dramatic cliffs and beaches, is so stunning and beautiful. Maria always drives on the way out and John always drives on the way back. They think it's the fairest way to share the burden of driving. It's also the best way to make sure that the driver is always paying attention to the road. When it's Maria's turn to be a passenger, she can look out the window and enjoy the scenery, knowing that John is driving safely. One weekend, John and Maria thought they should invite Pablo for the drive. He eagerly offered to drive, promising John and Maria that he would only pay attention to the road. For the first thirty minutes, Pablo was not distracted. He paid attention to the road and drove with caution. After an hour of driving though, he couldn't keep his eyes away from the coast and occasionally peaked to the side to take a look. During one of these peaks, he began to swerve and nearly collided with an oncoming car. While John and Maria yelled at Pablo for being careless and irresponsible, Pablo was lucky on this occasion.

This is just one example of how distractions that are not even in the car can be a problem and endanger your ability to focus while you drive. Focus is essential to driving. It is one aspect of those key elements of driving that include timely, proper judgment and the use of your senses. Driving on scenic roads can be distracting. Who doesn't want to look out the window and enjoy the scenery? But is it worth risking a collision as well as the safety of yourself and your passengers?

Outside distractions are not restricted to ocean side drives. Driving in a city with bright lights, passing by billboards or storefronts can all be sources of distraction. You may think you are only looking away for a moment, just for a quick look, but even a few seconds with your eyes off the road can lead to disaster.

#### Other Distractions

Some other outside distractions that have been listed by the California DMV include:

- **Collisions**: Staring at collisions not only causes traffic but also can cause other collisions. The passersby are too busy trying to figure out what happened that they forget to look at where they are going.  
- **A car pulled over by a police officer**: Why did he or she get pulled over? Were they speeding? Will they get arrested? All of these thoughts might cross our minds as we drive past a car that has been pulled over. Not only are you unlikely to figure out what has happened, but you are more likely to get into a collision.
- **Addresses and street names**: We often get in the car and drive somewhere we've never been before. This means we have to be looking out for street names and specific addresses. If no one is in the car with us, we're on our own and that can make it difficult to find a building or a house. The best thing to do is to get a very good idea of where you're going. Do a quick search online and see if there are any landmarks near your destination that will make it easier to find. You might even want to pull over at some point to make sure you're going the right way and how much further you have to go.

### THE FACES OF DISTRACTED DRIVING

So far we have considered some imaginary situations involving John, Pablo, and Maria where distractions could seriously hamper good driving. In reality, texting, cell phone use, eating, drinking and other distractions have had real life fatal consequences and continue to do so.

On September 15, 2010, Ani Voskanian, 20, drove through a stop sign while she was texting. She ran over and killed 80-year old Misak Ranjbar. She was charged with vehicular manslaughter, which is a felony. (Source: Los Angeles Times)

On July 25, 2009, 19-year-old Eric Okerblom was killed when his bike was struck by a truck traveling at 60 MPH. Cell phone records indicate that the driver was texting just prior to the collision. (Source: US Government website for distracted driving)

These are only two of the countless victims of distracted driving. Don't add to these numbers by being a distracted driver.

The road is full of surprises. A car can switch lanes suddenly, a pedestrian can seem to emerge from nowhere, a light can change, anything can happen. You should always stay focused and pay attention. It's only by following these tips that you can successfully deal with the unexpected, avoiding any type of collision.

# Chapter 11: The Vehicle

While driver behavior is by far the number one cause of car collisions, equipment failure is in the top four. You could be the most cautious, considerate, and experienced driver, but if you don't take care of your vehicle you dramatically increase your chances of a collision. What if your brakes failed? If there was a car a few feet away and you had to brake suddenly, you would no doubt hit that car. What if your headlights and fog lights went out in the middle of a storm? The cars around you would not be able to see you and you would not be able to see them, increasing your chances of a dangerous and possibly deadly collision.

#### REQUIRED SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE

#### Lighting

Vehicle lighting plays three important roles. First the headlights act as the driver’s eyes. They help the driver see the road ahead and help the driver see at night. Second, the taillights make the vehicle visible to drivers behind you both at night and during the day. Third, the brake lights tell drivers that you are slowing down or stopping.

**Headlights**: Every vehicle except motorcycles must have two working headlights on the front of the vehicle. When the headlights are set to low beam, it should be of sufficient intensity to reveal any persons or vehicles at a distance of at least 100 feet ahead. When operating your high beams, it should be of sufficient intensity to reveal any persons or vehicles at a distance of at least 350 feet ahead. You must turn the headlights on at least half an hour after sunset to half an hour before sunrise. In addition, you should use the headlights when it is cloudy, foggy, raining or snowing, on frosty mornings when other drivers' windows may be icy or foggy, and on small country or mountain roads. You should use headlights any time you have trouble seeing other cars because they're probably having trouble seeing you too! In fact, the law requires you to turn on your headlights whenever weather conditions prevent you from clearly seeing a person or other motor vehicle on the highway from a distance of 1000 feet, or when driving in conditions that require your windshield wipers to be in continuous use.

**Taillights**: Every vehicle except motorcycles must also have two working red taillights on the back of the vehicle. For vehicles manufactured after January 1, 1969 its taillights should be plainly visible from all distances within 1000 feet to the rear. For vehicles manufactured prior to January 1, 1969 the required visibility distance is 500 feet. Taillights automatically turn on when the headlights activated, and your vehicle visible from behind.

**Brake Lights**: These are the red lights on the rear of the vehicle that are activated automatically every time you apply the brake pedal. Every vehicle other than a motorcycle must be equipped with two red brake lights, which are visible from a distance of 300 feet to the rear both during normal sunlight and at night. In addition a vehicle may also have a supplemental brake light mounted on the rear window of the vehicle as long as it is not visible to the driver.

If you are towing a trailer or semi-trailer, they must be equipped with their own two red brake lights. Trailers less than 30 inches wide and manufactured after July 1973 need only one brake light near the center.

Keep all the lights on your car clean to maximize the light they give out. If a light burns out, take care of it immediately. It’s dangerous and illegal to drive with a burned out light.

#### Instrument panel
Always keep an eye on the instrument panel. It tells you a lot of important information, even with just a glance. You can know how much gas you have, the car's speed, and the car's total miles driven. Your instrument panel might also have indicators for low fuel, low oil pressure, low tire pressure and faults in the airbag (SRS) system. It might even tell you that it's time to have your engine checked. Low gas and low tire pressure can be hugely stressful so always take a quick look at the panel to ensure that everything is normal.

#### Belts and Fluid Levels
Think of the car's fluids as the car's blood. You need regular blood tests and your car needs regular fluid checks. You car's service manual will tell you the minimum recommended maintenance services for your car. Use it as a guide, but remember that your driving habits and even the roads on which you drive can affect how often belts and fluids need to be checked and changed.

TEST YOURSELF
1.	What is the purpose of your car's lights?
First the headlights act as the driver’s eyes. They help the driver see the road ahead and help the driver see at night. Second, the taillights make the vehicle visible to drivers behind you both at night and during the day. Third, the brake lights tell drivers that you are slowing down or stopping.
```

### Horn
Apart from a vehicle's lights, the horn is another excellent way to communicate with other road users. It's like the car's voice. It's the most obvious way to get another driver's attention to warn them of your presence or of an oncoming obstacle or hazard. Car horns are manufactured so that they can be heard from 200 feet away. You should never tamper with the horn to make it louder. You can be cited for a horn that is too loud. It's irritating and distracting to other drivers as well as the neighborhoods you're driving through. Unlike headlights, horns rarely malfunction, but if yours does, get it repaired immediately. Without the horn, you lose the additional layer of security of being able to get someone's attention.

#### Windshields and Mirrors
The windshields and mirrors help the driver to see the environment around him or her. The windshield also protects you from debris and foreign materials that could obstruct your view of the road. Mirrors are equally important. They allow us to check on the traffic behind us, which is important when you're trying to change lanes or turn.

#### Windshields
All vehicles must be equipped with an adequate windshield and rear window. What does this mean? First, the glass must be made of shatterproof material. That way, if a vehicle is involved in a collision, the driver and passengers won't be injured by broken and flying glass. Second, the windshield must be clean and have functioning windshield wipers. And finally, the windshield and rear window should be in good condition without any cracks or holes that will impair the driver's ability to see to the front or back. You can be cited or even arrested if you are driving with a windshield or rear window that does not comply.

#### Mirrors
California law is also clear about mirrors. The law requires that your car have at least two rear view mirrors that allow the driver to see at least 200 feet to the rear. One mirror must be mounted on the exterior left side and the other can be mounted on either the exterior right side of the vehicle OR in the interior. If the driver’s rear view is obstructed because of the design of the vehicle or because of its contents or an item being towed, there must be a rear view mirror installed at BOTH the left and right exterior.

#### Brakes
Brakes are an essential component of the car. They are designed to bring your car to a stop while still giving you control and steering ability. The braking system is so important that even national standards have been set: All passenger vehicles traveling at 20mph must be able to stop in 25 feet.

#### Service Brakes vs. Parking Brake
All vehicles have to be equipped with two braking systems: a dual hydraulic system (also known as service brakes) and a mechanical brake system (parking or emergency brakes). What is the difference between these brakes? When you press on the service brakes, you apply braking action on all four wheels. These are the brakes you use while driving, to slow down, to stop and to control the speed of the car.

The parking brakes only activate the rear brakes. When you are parked on an incline, you use the parking brakes to ensure that your vehicle is stable and will not roll down the hill. For this reason, the parking brake must be able to hold the vehicle on any grade and under all conditions that it is operated. You must be able to apply both the service brake and the parking brake separately.

#### Maintaining the Brakes
Check the brake fluid level at least once a month, but also have a qualified technician inspect the brakes. Make sure you have the brake cables lubricated and adjusted. If the brake pedal feels lower than usual, your vehicle pulls to one side while braking or makes any noises such as grinding or squealing, have them checked out by a service technician immediately. Your brakes might need to be realigned or replaced. This is not the kind of information you want to discover while driving 60mph on the highway! You can also check the working condition of the parking brake. Apply the parking brake and slowly ease off the service brake while still in drive to make sure your vehicle doesn't move.

### Tires
If you were a long distance runner, you would get your feet regularly examined by a podiatrist. You would make sure you have the proper shoes, with adequate cushioning and shock-absorption. When it comes to cars, tires are the car's feet and running shoes. Driving a car with deflated or worn out tires is similar to running with a sprained ankle or worn out running shoes. You won't be able to get very far and you're most likely to cause a severe injury.

Tires have two functions. Just like running shoes, they are air-filled cushions that help absorb the shock caused by road hazards or poor road conditions. Tires also grip the road to provide you with traction, protecting you from skids and hydroplaning.

#### Tire Inflation
If your tires are properly inflated, they will provide the best traction they can offer. If your tires are under-inflated, your car won't work efficiently and will waste gas. This will also affect tire wear and your ability to properly handle and control the vehicle. Under-inflated tires are also more likely to blow out. Check your vehicle's manual for the recommended tire pressure and check it regularly using a pressure gauge.

#### Tread Conditions
Similar to running shoes, tires have grooved surfaces called treads. These treads are designed to push water, snow, hail, sleet, mud, and more out from under the tire so that it stays grounded and touching the pavement. As the tire wears out, the tread gradually becomes thinner and eventually the tire surface becomes smooth. You should replace the tires before they become smooth. Smooth or bald tires are just like worn out running shoes: they won't grip the road and cause the vehicle to slide.

According to the law, tires must have at least one thirty-seconds (1/32) of an inch depth in any two adjacent grooves at any location of the tire. You can check you tire's tread by doing the penny test. Take a penny and put Lincoln's head into one of the grooves of the tire tread. If you can't see part of his head, the tire has enough tread. But if you can see all of Lincoln's head, then it's time for a new tire.

When you're done with the penny test, take a look at your tires and check for signs of wear, such as bulges and splits in the tread or sidewall. Check for uneven wear, too. It might indicate that one tire is more inflated than the others or that your brakes or alignment need to be checked out. If you rotate your tires every 12,000 miles, you can equalize the wear of your tires and give them a longer life span.

<br><div><h3>REQUIRED SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLE MAINTENANCE (continued)</h3></div><div><h2><i>Seats, Seat Belts and Airbags</i></h2></div><div>Sometimes even the most cautious and experienced driver can be involved in a collision. If the driver was alert and focused, the severity of the collision will be much less.&nbsp;This increases the chance that the people involved will survive the crash.&nbsp;Another important factor that will determine the outcome of a crash is whether or not the occupants were wearing seat belts. The single most important safety device in any kind of collision is the seat belt. Seat belts restrain the driver and the passengers during a collision and keep them from hitting the hard surfaces of the car, such as the windshield. Air bags are intended to cushion the driver and front seat passenger from the force of the impact, but they do not replace seat belts.</div>The law requires that you use your&nbsp;seat belt. If your car is a 1968 or later model the law requires that it must have a seat belt in good working condition. It also requires that the driver and all passengers 16 and older wear a seat belt. Children under the age of 16 must be restrained in a seat belt, safety seat, or booster seat, depending on the child's size. It doesn't matter where your passengers are sitting, everyone must be safely restrained. Any passenger over 16 years of age can be cited for not wearing his or her seat belt. It's also the driver's responsibility to ensure that he or she is wearing a seat belt and that all other passengers are also restrained. Remember, a police officer may stop you for a seat belt infraction.</div><br><h4>Air Bags</h4><div>Some of us have heard about the dangers surrounding airbags. What is the best way to stay safe and protected while driving? Adjust your seat before you drive. Make sure your head Is at least ten inches from your driver air bag. Keep in mind that you have to be able to reach the pedals and steering wheel comfortably and easily. If pulling your seat ten inches away from the steering wheel is too far, you can adjust your seat to maintain the ten-inch distance while being able to reach the steering wheel and pedals. You can recline the back of the seat, move the seat rearward or, if your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. Always drive belted and sitting ten inches away from the steering wheel.</div>&nbsp; <div>(Source: NHTSA)&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p><div><h2><i>Child Safety Equipment</i></h2></div><div>Children, because of their size and age, are more vulnerable to the dangers of a car.

TEST YOURSELF What is this?
1.	What should you do if your tire blows out while you are driving?
Grip the steering wheel firmly and steer to keep your vehicle in a straight line. Once you have control of the car, ease off the gas pedal to start slowing down. Activate your turn signal, and press the brakes gently to slow down even more. Steer slowly off the road as far away from traffic as possible. Park your car and turn on your hazard lights.

In order to avoid any devastating collisions between cyclists and motorists, additional precautions have been taken. On some roads, there are designated bike lanes. They are marked by a solid white lane and usually have the image of a cyclist. They are narrower than a usual lane but are just like any other lane. Would you cross over the white line and use two lanes? The answer is no. The same should apply for bike lanes. Cyclists are road users and you should respect their designated lanes. The only time you can drive in the bicycle lane is when you are going to make a right turn. Once you are within 200 feet of the corner, make sure you will not be colliding with any cyclists and then enter the bicycle lane.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other roads that aren’t wide enough for a bike lane have markings that show that vehicles and bicycles must share the road.&nbsp;These markings, called sharrows, alert drivers to watch out for bicyclists on that part of the road.</p><div><i><h2>Properly Ending Left or Right Turns</h2></i></div><div>Most people know where to start their left or right turn, but it is just as important to know where to end the turn.&nbsp;</div>&nbsp; <div><b>Genera Rules for Left turns</b>:&nbsp;If you are going to make a left turn, position yourself in lane closest to the left. Use the center left turn lane if one is available.&nbsp;Start signaling about 100 feet before the turn. Slow down <span>and stop behind the limit line. You must yield to all pedestrians crossing the road and other vehicles coming from the opposite direction, including any cars making a right turn. Scan the road, left, center and right. Make the turn only when it’s safe and do not cut the corner! End your turn in <i>any</i> lane as long as no one else is trying to use that lane. &nbsp;This applies whether you are turning into a one-way street or a two-way street.&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>General Rules for Right turns</b>: If you are going to make a right turn, position yourself in the farthest right lane. Check for pedestrians and bicycles and start signaling about 100 feet before the turn. Look over your right shoulder and slow down, stopping behind the limit line. Look both ways, especially for pedestrians who might be stepping on or off the sidewalk.&nbsp;Yield to any pedestrians who are already crossing the street or are about to cross and make your turn only when it is clear and safe. End your turn in the lane nearest the right-hand curb.</div><br><br><img width="400" border="2" height="479" alt="" src="https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Left%20turn%20Right%20turn.jpg"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Other Examples of Left and Right turns:</b> &nbsp;</p><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Left turn from a one-way street onto a two-way street</b>: When turning left from a one-way street you should position yourself in the farthest left lane and may turn into any lane that is available.</li><li><b>Left turn from a two-way street onto a one-way street</b>: Position<b> </b>yourself in the far left lane of your side of the road and turn into any lane that is available.</li></ul><p><img style="width: 377px; height: 305px" alt="" src="https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/left%20turn%20right%20turn2%20copy.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Two or more left turn lanes</b>: If more than one lane is indicated for left turns, you may use either lane, but you must stay in your lane and end the turn in the corresponding lane.&nbsp; </li><li><b>Right turn from a one</b>-<b>way street into a one-way street</b>: Position yourself in the farthest right lane.

<br><div><h3>HOW TO USE LANES PROPERLY (continued)</h3></div><div><i><h2>Center Left Turn Lane</h2></i></div><div>Center left turn lanes are located in the middle of a two way street. They are marked by two lines on each side. The inner line is a broken line and the outer one is solid. If a street has a center left turn lane you may use it to turn left. The two lines indicate that this is not a regular traffic lane, so don't use it as one! Even if you are sitting in heavy traffic, you are not allowed to use the center left turn lane to cut through to the left turn only lane. If you are going to make a left turn (into a driveway) you can only drive in this lane for 200 feet.</div>&nbsp; <div><b>Left turn:</b> To make a left turn from this lane, follow the usual lane changing procedure: signal, check your mirrors and blind spots and switch into this lane. Make sure you are completely in the lane. You don't want the rear of the vehicle in another lane. This could cause traffic and even a collision. Unlike a regular left turn lane you might have other cars driving towards you in the center left turn lane to also make a left turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><br><img style="width: 596px; height: 305px" alt="" src="/course-images/image/Center%20left%20turn%20lane2%20copy(1).jpg"><br><br>&nbsp;</div><div><i><h2>Sharing Lanes with Motorcycles</h2></i></div><div>Just like cyclists, motorcyclists are a more vulnerable group of road users. They too have to obey the same traffic laws, but they too are harder to notice on the road. As a general rule, you should allow motorcycles the width of an entire lane. There are occasions however where "lane splitting" may happen. Because of their small size, motorcycles are able to travel faster than traffic during periods of heavy congestion. They legally can use the space between two lanes of traffic which is known as lane splitting. If you are sharing a lane with a motorcycle, be careful. Don't squeeze them out of the flow of traffic or try to force them into another lane!</div><br></div>

<br><div><h3>PASSING OTHER VEHICLES</h3></div><div>Passing is very dangerous and should be done only when it is completely safe. But sometimes it is hard to judge how dangerous a situation really is.&nbsp;Much of this depends on how far ahead you can see and whether or not you have room to safely pass.</div><br><div><i><h2>Special Situations</h2></i></div><div>These are situations that are confusing for many drivers because the dangers of passing may not be completely obvious.</div><br><ul class="txt-list"><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Bridges, viaducts and tunnels:</b> If your view is blocked as you approach within 100 feet of a bridge, viaduct or tunnel, you may not pass.</li><li><b>Hills:</b> When you are driving up or down a hill, you have limited visibility. You often can't see oncoming cars and they can't see you. For this reason, you should not pass on hills. Only pass if the hill or curve is at least one-third of a mile away, but avoid passing on the hill itself.</li><li><b>Intersections and railroad crossings:</b> It is illegal to pass within 100 feet of intersections and railroad crossings. If you are further than 100 feet away, you should decide whether you can pass safely.</li><li><b>Class A and Class B vehicles:</b> Class A and class B vehicles tend to be commercial trucks, farm vehicles and buses. Their size and weight makes it difficult for them to slow down, so attempting to pass them could be very dangerous. Only pass them when it's absolutely necessary. Do you have an exit or a turn approaching? If so, avoid passing these vehicles and wait for a better opportunity. If you have to pass these large vehicles, pass on the left and allow for more than the usual 10-12 seconds to pass. Don't forget to give yourself more room to enter as well. You don't want to cut these vehicles off. They might not be able to slow down fast enough to avoid rear ending you.</li></ul></ul><h2><i>Dangerous Situations</i></h2><div>There are some situations that may not be technically illegal to pass, but the fact that you end up doing other illegal moves to make the pass happen still makes them illegal and extremely dangerous.&nbsp;</div>&nbsp; <ul class="txt-list"><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Long line of vehicles ahead:</b> If you are trying to pass more than one vehicle, this means you are on the wrong side of the road for too long. It may be difficult for you to get back into your lane. This is not safe!</li><li><b>Intention to stop or turn:</b> Passing someone when you know you are going to stop or turn in front of them is an act of aggressive driving. This can create a rear end crash with you on the receiving end.</li><li><b>Vehicle is at or near speed limit:</b> It's simple. If you have to exceed the speed limit in order to pass a vehicle ahead of you because he is already at or near the speed limit, you should not be passing him. Don't exceed the speed limit to pass another driver.</li><li><b>Sight or distance ahead is limited:</b> Remember safety first! If you can't see the distance needed to make the pass, you should assume there is a car there and stay where you are.</li><li><b>Unable to pass before reaching a no passing zone:</b> No passing zones are places in the road where it is just too dangerous to pass. It may be because it is harder to see ahead or because the road is too narrow.&nbsp;</li></ul></ul></div>

<br><div><h3>RIGHT-OF-WAY</h3></div><div>The rules of the road give drivers a lot of information about what they can and can't do and what they should do. Right-of-way rules tell motorists who has the higher priority over the other, in a given situation, and what the best way is to handle the situation. &nbsp;Below is a list of some of the most common right-of-way situations and how to handle them.</div><br><div><i><h2>Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Intersections</h2></i></div><div>Controlled intersections have some kind of device or sign telling drivers what to do. There are many different kinds of controlled intersections and each one has its own right-of-way rules:</div><br><ul class="txt-list"><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Four-way stop:</b> At a four way stop, the driver reaching the intersection first gets to go first. If two cars arrive at the same time, the right-of-way should be given to the car on the right. If there is no car on your right, then you technically "have" the right-of-way. But remember, you still have to make sure the other driver gives you the right-of-way before hitting the gas pedal.</li><li><b>Yield signs:</b> A yield sign facing you means you are about to enter an area where other road users have the right of way.&nbsp;Slow down as you approach the yield sign and be prepared to stop if you see another road user already using that part of the road.&nbsp;This could be the car going straight on the road you want to make a right turn on, or the pedestrian using the crosswalk in front of the yield sign.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Unprotected left or right turn:</b> These are turns made at any uncontrolled intersection or when a controlled intersection does not have a special turn light. The turn is also unprotected when a special left or right turn light ends -- while you are still allowed to turn, you don't have the "protection" of the light. If you are making an unprotected left turn, you should yield the right-of-way to all other traffic.</li><li><b>Intersections with a broken signal light:</b> If the traffic signal is not working, approach the intersection carefully and treat the broken signal like a four-way stop. Only drive ahead when it is your turn and it is safe.</li></ul></ul><br><h2><i>Vehicles Stopped at a Crosswalk</i></h2>Do not pass vehicles stopped at a crosswalk. They are most likely waiting for a pedestrian to cross the street. You could endanger the pedestrian. Wait for the car ahead of you to pass the crosswalk before you move forward. <div>&nbsp;</div><br><h2><i>Pedestrian's Right-of-Way at Crosswalks</i></h2><div>Pedestrian is anyone who is on foot but also includes people using a mobility devise such as a wheel chair, skateboard or electric scooter. <span>They always have the right-of-way at crosswalks no matter where they are!&nbsp;It doesn’t matter if the crosswalks are marked or not, have a signal light, a stop sign or no sign at all, you must yield to pedestrians.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><br><ul class="txt-list"><ul class="txt-list"><li>If you are going to make a right turn, wait at the limit line (not in the crosswalk) for pedestrians to clear the sidewalk before making your turn. Even if you have a green light, you must allow pedestrians to cross first.</li><li>Do not pass a vehicle that has stopped at a crosswalk. A pedestrian you cannot see may be crossing the street. Stop, and then proceed when all pedestrians have crossed the street.</li><li>Do not drive on a sidewalk, except to cross it to enter or exit a driveway or alley. When crossing, yield to all pedestrians.</li><li>Do not stop in a crosswalk. You will place pedestrians in danger.</li><li>Remember, if a pedestrian makes eye contact with you, he or she is ready to cross the street. Yield to the pedestrian.</li><li>Allow older pedestrians, disabled pedestrians, and pedestrians with young children sufficient time to cross the street.</li></ul></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><i>Bicyclist's Right-of-Way</i></h2><div>Right-of-way rules are the same for bicycles and cars. They have to follow the same rules and have the same responsibilities as motorists. Motorists must remember that bicyclists are entitled to share the road with other vehicles if they do not have a designated bike lane. They are also allowed to use turn lanes. So while motorists should treat bicyclists with more caution, they should not be surprised to see them cycling with traffic or using turn lanes. If cyclists are moving slowly, they should behave like any other slow moving vehicle and stay to the right.</div><br><h2><i>Anti-Gridlock Law</i></h2><div>What happens when drivers enter the intersection on a green light when the lanes are already backed up? The light turns red and, since the cars are still stuck in the intersection, other traffic can't get through. Gridlock! When passing through an intersection, you have to keep in mind California's anti-gridlock law. It is your responsibility to make sure you have enough space on the other side of the intersection or railroad crossing before entering the intersection. Blocking an intersection is not only inconsiderate to other drivers, but it is also dangerous and illegal.</div><br><h2><i>School Buses with Red Flashing Lights</i></h2><div>If you approach a school bus that has stopped with red signal lights flashing from either direction, you have to stop and wait for them to stop flashing before you move. The flashing lights tell drivers that passengers are loading or unloading. You cannot pass the bus or otherwise move until the lights are no longer flashing.</div><p>&nbsp;</p><div>You don't have to stop if the bus is on the opposite side of a physical barrier or divider such as a divided highway or multi-lane highway.</div></div>

```

TEST YOURSELF What is this?
1.	When do you NOT have to stop for a stopped school bus with red signal lights flashing?
NEVER
2.	The purpose of the California's Anti Gridlock Law is to prevent cars from blocking intersections at 4 way lights.
3.	What should you do if you approach a school bus with red signal lights flashing?
Stop and wait for them to stop flashing before you move.
4.	What is California's Anti Gridlock Law?
It's illegal to be stuck in the intersection at a red light not letting other traffic get through.

<br><div><h3>RIGHT-OF-WAY (continued)</h3></div><div><i><h2>Road or Lane Narrows</h2></i></div><div>If a road or lane narrows or ends, two lanes will have to merge into one. In these instances, merging traffic always has to yield. In other words, if you are driving in the right hand lane and your lane is ending, you will have to merge with the left lane. The left lane, that is the lane that continues, will have the right-of-way. If your lane narrows or ends, you must yield to the rest of traffic and merge when it is safe. If you are in the lane that is continuing on, be courteous and let the other driver merge into your lane!</div><br><h2><i>Entering Freeways</i></h2>Freeway traffic always has the right-of-way, so entering motorists must be quick and cautious to merge into traffic. Most freeways have acceleration lanes which allow the vehicles entering the freeway to reach the speed of traffic and merge more easily. Even when you reach the speed of traffic while in the acceleration lane, you do not have the right-of-way once your lane merges with the rest of the freeway. You have to yield to freeway traffic until you find a safe merging point.<div>&nbsp;</div><br><h2><i>Railroad Crossings</i></h2><div>The Federal Railroad Administration reports there are over 3000 train collisions every year and almost 900 fatalities on this country's 200,000 railroad crossings. It seems motorists don't take railroad crossings seriously.</div><div><br><img border="2" alt="" width="500" height="320" src="../course-images/image/Train.jpg"><br><br>&nbsp;</div><div>But the reality is that trains travel at very high speeds. Even at slower speeds, a train requires a very long distance to stop. A train traveling at 50 mph will take a mile and a half to come to a complete stop. A train can also cross at any time so you must be extra cautious when crossing a railroad.</div><br><div>For this reason, trains always have the right-of-way. It does not matter if the railroad crossing is protected (gated) or unprotected (un-gated), you should cross the tracks carefully and always yield to oncoming trains. If the crossing is unprotected and you see a train approaching, don't take a chance. Do not try to race across the tracks hoping to outrun the train. If you miscalculate the speed of the train or if your car stalls, it will be impossible for the train to stop in time, thus leading to a deadly collision.</div><br><h2><i>Traffic Breaks</i></h2><div>It occasionally happens. You are driving on the freeway and you see a large object on the road. Sometimes it's not a large enough hazard to get the CHP involved, but other times these objects are very dangerous! They can range from stalled cars to mattresses and construction equipment. The CHP may be called in to create a traffic break so that the object may be removed. Traffic breaks are most often created by an officer driving back and forth across all the lanes with his lights flashing. If you see an officer creating a traffic break, you must yield to the officer. Do not try to drive past the officer! Wait for the CHP to clear the road and to end the traffic break.</div><br><br></div>

<div><h3>ADJUST YOUR DRIVING FOR THE CONDITIONS</h3></div><div>Once you've learned and mastered the rules of the road, you have to be able to adjust to changing roads and road conditions. It's rare that drivers are faced with the same driving conditions all the time. A good driver has to take the rules of the road and adjust his or her driving to the environment. For example, you can't drive on the freeway the same way you would in the city. Your speed will be different, the obstacles you are looking for will be different and the techniques you use will be different.</div><br><div><i><h2>Demands of City Driving</h2></i></div><div>While city driving may be exciting with all its lights and sounds and people, it is these distractions that make driving in the city so difficult. Take extra care when driving through the city. Reduce your speed, watch out for but don't watch the pedestrians and try to reduce the distractions inside your car. It's also important to avoid being a "rubber neck," a person who slows down to see what is happening on the side of the road. This doesn't mean you shouldn't be aware of the situation; you just shouldn't stare at it.</div>
<br><ul class="txt-list"><ul class="txt-list"><li><b>Look ahead of traffic:</b> Make it a point to look 10 to 15 seconds ahead and you will likely catch the majority of hazards liable to endanger you. If you catch these early enough, you have sufficient time to respond to them accordingly. Always scan the road for hazards! <br>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Leave enough distance to maneuver:</b> Always leave enough distance between you and the vehicles or hazards around you. The more room you leave the more room you will have to maneuver yourself to safety should you need to. Follow the three-second rule. When you have stopped, always leave at least one car length between you and the car in front of you. <br>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Anticipate signal light changes:</b> When scanning ahead of traffic, you should pay attention to and anticipate signal light changes. How long has the light been green? If you have been paying attention, you will be able to tell if it is going to stay green or turn yellow once you've reached the intersection. Avoid crossing the intersection when the signal is yellow.  Drivers in the cross traffic may enter the intersection as soon as their light turns green, and if you are still in the intersection, a crash would be hard to avoid.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Other road users:</b>&nbsp;Unlike driving on the freeway, city driving is especially challenging because of the variety of road users. In a city, you share the road with other cars, bicycles, pedestrians and buses. Scan the road for these other road users and respect their right to share the road with you.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;</li><li><b>Cover the brake, don't ride it:</b> When you are driving in a city, cover the brake. In other words, let your foot hover over the brake pedal, ready to brake immediately if it becomes necessary. Do not ride the brake though! When you are riding the brake you are touching the brake pedal which causes the brake lights to illuminate. This can be very confusing to the drivers behind you. They will wonder why you are stopping. Cover the brake instead of riding it.</li></ul></ul><br></div>

<br><div><h3>ADJUST YOUR DRIVING FOR THE CONDITIONS (continued)</h3></div><br><div><i><h2>Demands of Freeway Driving</h2></i></div><div>Freeway driving is very different from city driving. Freeway driving is faster paced and requires a special set of skills unique to the freeway.</div><br><img border="2" alt="" width="500" height="333" src="../course-images/image/Closed_on-ramp.jpg"><br><br><br><div><h4>Plan a Route in Advance</h4></div><div>You can avoid confusion and dangerous moves on the freeway by planning your route ahead of time. Be familiar with your entrance and exit. If you are driving somewhere unfamiliar, try to leave while it is still daylight.</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div><h4>When Entering the Freeway</h4></div><div>Acceleration lanes exist at many freeway entrances. They permit vehicles that are entering to accelerate and reach the speed of traffic in order to merge more easily. Be familiar with entrance signs that warn of curves, speed limits and merge areas. Adjust your speed to the posted speed limit on the entrance ramp. While on the ramp, check the flow of traffic on the freeway. Judge the speed and spacing of the vehicles. Try to locate a gap in the traffic. Watch the vehicle ahead for sudden stops; many drivers reduce speed and even stop while attempting to merge. Check the freeway again and locate the gap that you will use to merge onto the freeway. Activate your left turn signal and begin to match your speed to the freeway traffic. Check the mirror and blind spot, and then merge into the gap. Cancel the turn signal once you are safely in your lane.</div>&nbsp; <div><h4>Choosing Your Lane</h4></div><div>If you are on a two-lane freeway you should use the right-hand lane when you enter and just prior to exiting. The left lane is for passing and faster traffic. Be prepared to move right and allow faster moving vehicles to pass. When on a three-lane or larger freeway you should drive in the right lane when you enter the freeway, just before exiting and if you are driving less than the posted speed limit. The center lanes should be used when driving at or near the speed limit and when driving long distances. The left lane should be used for passing or preparing to exit when the exit is on the left side of the freeway. Often a freeway divides into three or more different routes called interchanges. When approaching an interchange, avoid merging conflicts by changing lanes to the left or by adjusting your speed.</div>&nbsp; <div><h4>Speed Limits</h4></div><div>California's "Basic Speed Law" says that you must never drive faster than is safe for the present conditions, regardless of the posted speed limit. When road, weather, visibility or traffic conditions are not ideal, the driver must determine what is safe for the existing conditions. The posted maximum speed limit is the <i>maximum </i>speed at which you can legally drive in a particular zone. A minimum speed limit may also be posted to keep traffic from moving too slowly. Driving too slowly during good conditions is as illegal as driving too fast.&nbsp;A very slow driver blocks the flow of traffic and essentially forces other drivers to make risky last minute lane changes to avoid the slow vehicle.&nbsp;</div>&nbsp; <div><h4>Keep a Space Cushion around your Vehicle</h4></div><div>A space cushion is the empty area to the front, back and sides of your vehicle.&nbsp;The bigger the space cushion, the more options you have to maneuver out of a problem nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp;What if the car in front of you unexpectedly stalls? If you are surrounded by cars in every direction, you won't have many options for an exit strategy. In fact, you might rear-end the car in front of you before you have a chance to escape.</div><br><div>Establish a space cushion by increasing the minimum three-second following distance to at least four seconds.&nbsp;Avoid driving next to other cars or in clusters of cars to increase your space cushion to the sides.&nbsp;The only area that you have the least control over your space cushion is behind you.&nbsp;You can't exactly stop a tailgater, but at least if you have enough room to the front and sides you can get away from him or allow him to pass you.</div><br><img border="2" alt="" width="500" height="358" src="https://www.5dollartrafficschoolstop.com/course-images/image/Space%20Cushion.jpg"><br><br><br><div><h4>Freeway Emergencies</h4></div><div>&nbsp;When you come across a blocked roadway on the freeway you should reduce your speed, check for an open lane next to you and steer around the obstacle. If you are not able to steer around the obstacle and stopping becomes your only option, tap the brake pedal before applying the brakes to warn the vehicles behind you. If needed turn on the hazard lights&nbsp;to warn&nbsp;other drivers.</div>&nbsp; <div><h4>When Exiting the Freeway</h4></div><div>When you are planning to exit the freeway, scan ahead for signs indicating the exit lane you are looking for. When you see your exit sign, start changing lanes to reach your exit lane. Give yourself ample time to reach the exit lane. If you miss your exit, do not try to dash across several lanes or attempt to back your vehicle on the freeway. Drive on to the next exit and then return to the desired exit on the other side of the freeway.</div><br><br></div>

<div><i><h2>The Open Highway</h2></i></div><div>The open highway can present a variety of surprises for drivers. You might find yourself sharing the road with some interesting road users, such as animals, horses, tractors and more.&nbsp;Be aware of these surprises and be prepared to deal with them.</div><div><br><h4>Unpredictable Road Conditions</h4></div><div>Open highways are often poorly maintained. When driving on an open highway, you may come across potholes, broken pavement, bumps and more. Slow down and try to avoid them. The road might not even be paved. If you are driving on gravel, sand or mud, this will affect your car's traction. Drive carefully. The roads can also vary in width. If you're driving on a narrow road, drive slowly and carefully and be especially careful with oncoming traffic.</div><div><br><h4>Environment</h4></div><div>Open highways are often characterized by curves and hills. Adjust your driving to accommodate the changing terrain. When approaching a curve, slow down but don't stop. If you are driving on a hill, shift to a lower gear even with an automatic transmission to make the engine turn faster and develop power to climb more easily. When on a downhill slope, shift to a lower gear. The lower gear will help control the speed. As you approach the top of the hill it will be difficult for you to see any oncoming traffic and even traffic that is ahead of you or behind you. Stay safe! Stay to the right of your lane and ease off the accelerator until your visibility increases. Mountain driving can be a greater challenge. High altitudes not only affect drivers but their cars as well. Your car may overheat so check the temperature gauge often.</div><br><div><h4>Other Road Users</h4></div><div>Since open highways are typically found in rural settings, you may come across some road users you don't often see in the city. You will be sharing the road with animals, tractors and slow moving vehicles. Watch out for signs that warn drivers about animal crossings. Once you spot one of these signs, be more vigilant in your scanning. Trucks and other slow moving vehicles can also be a challenge. Their sheer size means it takes them longer to speed up, slow down and turn. Don't try to cut them off to get ahead of these slow moving vehicles. Give the truck drivers their space! It's safer for everybody. Remember you are in the smaller vehicle; a collision would not end well for you.</div><h4>Lighting</h4></div><div>Open highways are often poorly lit. If you are driving on an open highway in the dark, use your high beam lights to ensure that you can see and are seen by other drivers.&nbsp; Be sure to switch to the standard headlights at a distance of 500 feet when there are oncoming vehicles or when you are 300 feet behind a vehicle that you are approaching from the rear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div><i><h2>Construction Zones</h2></i></div><div>You must be extra cautious and alert when driving through construction zones. Reduce your speed; look out for construction workers, flaggers and guide signs. These men and women are working under dangerous conditions. They do not have the protection of their cars as you do. Be considerate and cautious. If you are convicted of an offense against highway workers, you could be fined up to $2000 and/or a jail term of up to one year. All other citations received in construction zones are doubled.</div><br><div><i><h2>Traffic Congestion</h2></i></div><div><h4>Rubbernecking</h4></div><div>If you do drive past a crash don't slow down just to stare at it. This creates traffic and could even cause another collision. Of course you should slow down if you need to get past safely, or for a merging&nbsp;vehicle.</div><br><div><h4>Tailgating</h4></div><div>Tailgaters think that by driving right behind the car in front of them that they will miraculously get where they are going faster.&nbsp;All this does is annoy the driver in front and create a dangerous situation for both drivers. Always follow the three-second rule and avoid tailgating.</div><br><div><h4>Weaving</h4></div><div>Unnecessary lane changes, especially on the freeway, will not get you to your destination any faster. They simply cause a commotion, forcing other drivers to slow down and move over to avoid you.</div><br><div><h4>Distractions</h4></div><div>Eating, grooming, talking on the phone or even dealing with your children or pets can all force you to slow down unnecessarily or make bad decisions when driving.</div><br><div><h4>Poorly-maintained vehicles</h4></div><div>Make sure your vehicle is properly cared for. You don't want to be the driver whose car has stalled or who has run out of gas. Proper maintenance ensures your safety and well-paced traffic flow.</div><br><br></div>

<div id="RSad">                                                        
<br><div><i><h2>Driving in Different Weather Conditions</h2></i></div><div>The most unpredictable part about driving is the weather. When possible, avoid driving in bad weather. In most cases, you are unable to see properly. The risk you will be taking to drive in bad weather is just not worth it. If you must drive, however, be prepared to adjust your driving to better deal with different weather conditions.</div><div><h4>Rain</h4></div><div>Wet roads are slippery roads! This is especially true when it first starts to rain because the oil and dust on the road have not washed away yet.&nbsp;Slow down when it first starts to sprinkle or drizzle.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Continue to drive slowly once the rain gets heavier so you can avoid hydroplaning and the problem of decreasing visibility. &nbsp;Slowing down will increase your ability to see and give you precious time to react effectively to a possible problem. &nbsp;The heavier a rainstorm, the more difficult it is to see and be seen. &nbsp;Keep your headlights on and make sure your windshield wipers are working properly. If the humidity is making your windows foggy, keep defrosting them. When you can't see farther than 100 feet ahead, you should not be driving faster than 30 mph - keep this in mind the next time you are on the freeway in a storm.&nbsp;</div><br><div>Since it takes longer to stop and slow down in the rain the only way you can ensure that you will be able to stop safely is if you are driving slowly. &nbsp;Make sure you follow the three-second plus rule to leave a generous space in front. What if there is a problem up ahead and you have to stop suddenly? If you are following the car in front of you too closely you might not be able to avoid a collision, so maintain a safe distance of least four seconds.</div><br><div><h4>Snow and Icy Roads</h4></div><div>If you will be driving in a snowstorm, you'll be facing many of the same challenges as driving in the rain except more so. Icy, snowy roads can be much more dangerous than wet ones, and the only way to get through all the snow is with snow tires or chains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the chains fit your tires and that you know how to put them on before you get on the road.</div><p>&nbsp;</p><div>Falling snow can be blinding.&nbsp;If the snow is too much for your windshield wipers to handle, pull over and clear up your windshields. It's hard enough to drive in a snowstorm. Don't make it more difficult and dangerous by allowing the snow to accumulate.</div><div><h4>Fog</h4></div><div>Heavy fog can make it impossible to see. You might be able to see only a few feet or so ahead of you! If at all possible, avoid driving in fog. If you must drive, slow down! It will be easier to spot other vehicles and to stop if you are driving slowly. Add a few more seconds to the three-second-plus rule. Use your low beams or fog lights to see and be seen. If the fog gets even thicker as you drive and you really can't see, don't continue driving. Pull off the road until the condition improves. Turn off any headlights or brake lights. Cars behind you might think you are still driving and follow your lights leading them off the road and rear-ending you.</div><br><div><h4>Sandstorms and Dust Storms</h4></div><div>Dust storms can catch you off guard. Much like other difficult weather conditions, these storms can decrease visibility severely. If you find yourself stuck in a dust storm, the best thing to do is to pull off the road and wait for the storm to pass.</div><br><br></div>
